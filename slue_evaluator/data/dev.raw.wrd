madam president first of all i would like to thank all the members who have participated in this important debate for their different contributions
there i look forward to continuing to work with you on the effort sharing proposal and bringing it to a successful conclusion with your support
we all agreed at the last session in % strasbourg ] that development is important but we need to remember it now when we are talking about the financial contributions
we need to invest in enablers of development and yes most of all we need to invest in good governance
they are ready to give ( thousands of euros ] to traffickers because there is not good governance
many migrants are not even extremely poor but they are all extremely desperate
if we get back for example to the issue of migration we will see that this is the key question the question of governance
poverty war and also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people undertake dangerous journeys in the search for a better life in * europe ] and development cooperation is an important part of the answer to this challenge
in all these efforts ahead of the # thirteenth national conference ] in % addis ababa ] we need to be aware of the fact that finance alone will not be sufficient policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals we need policies that will ensure that financial resources are used effectively and in areas that will bring further mobilisation of resources and sustainable development
furthermore we need a completely new approach to financing development
this is the first regulatory act which will provide police in all member states with their common rules
i suppose and i am sure that it is not the end of the discussion or even the beginning of the discussion because it is a very complicated package and i do not think that all of our members have read the full package
we have to be ready for that
this does not mean that we have to be technologically ahead of technology we have to be very firm on our principal ground it is the fundamental right of people to be people people ~ first ] with technology for people
nanotechnology is ahead of us
was ! one ] of the reasons that brought us to the financial crisis
could we not do more and could you perhaps be more specific about what has been done so far what are your aims
mr president i also want to raise the issue of respect for religious freedom for all without discrimination because this is a basic human right
` efsi ] also contributes to the # cop twenty one ] objectives to keep sustainable development and environment objectives in mind ` efsi ] also increases the local presence level through the reinforcing of the ` european investment advisory hub ]
we all know that some member states will do their best to weaken this legislation
we took many measures to improve the situation and i believe we achieved certain improvements
with climate change bringing more extreme weather events we need to be able to protect human lives and valuable assets and to make our regions our cities and our towns more resilient
as for energy @ three years ago ] the % eu ] heads of government decided to set the current year @ two thousand and fourteen ] as a clear deadline for the completion of an internal energy market
well all is on track the commission action plans have been published and updated
` parliament ] also says clearly that it urges the member states which are absent here not to impose any obligation on encryption providers that would result in the weakening or compromising of the security of their networks or services such as the creation or facilitation of back doors
for the % eu ] the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and inclusive electoral process and to be prepared for a range of scenarios
but we should not lose sight of the big picture
the ) irish ] system works within a legal and regulatory policy directive framework dictated by the % eu ]
% ireland ] is no worse or better than any other place i object to hostile comments about % ireland ] emanating from % london ] % new york ] and the % german ] media
all these places have experienced regulatory and banking challenges and problems equal to and in many cases far worse than those we have faced in % ireland ]
the constant sniping from some of our % eu ] neighbours has been based on prejudice rather than objective fact and does little for % eu ] solidarity at a time when * europe ] is going through enormous financial and economic challenges
thank you very much for the question
raising funds for research and care addressing discrimination at work and advocating policy change by decision makers all depend on prior awareness and understanding of multiple sclerosis
our choice tomorrow is to go for a strong mandate with a ban and go for negotiations or go for negotiations using our mandate as a starting point and end up with something meaningless
in exchange we got the protection of the vulnerable marine ecosystems
and yet @ one month ] after we adopted our compromise the council did not put it on the agenda did not even present it i used this time to talk to the member states and the presidencies
if this compromise is further watered down it will become meaningless
if you want to change the rules in ` parliament ] on the balance of the countries you have to change it ~ first ] in the ` council ] and then we will see finally i fully understand the position of the ` council ] in the spitzenkandidaten issue but they also have to understand ours because we have to approve
the candidate we have to approve their programme and we have to approve the college
cases finally you were in the % us ] @ last week ] i hope you had interesting meetings
you would you have updates to give us @ today ] on the shopping antitrust
in this report we strongly support the independence of the commission and the national competition authorities
the ~ first ] time was with commissioner } almunia ] in
as you know this is a nonbinding report but it sends a strong political message to the commission
@ two thousand and thirteen ] this may be the last competition report of this term next year we will have ) european ] elections again
yet the importance of our partnership with the ` eib ] and with the % european union ] in meeting our commitments both to our shareholders and to our countries of operations is clearer than ever
~ second ] under the aegis of the % european union ] new structures of cooperation between ` ebrd ] and ` eib ] offer great new opportunities for us to work together
these initiatives facilitated by ` ec ] funds bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and as such offer an excellent crucible in which to forge the development of our joint work
with this wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and cooperation mechanisms to do so and we see as we saw @ last august ] when faced with the conflict driven banking crisis in % georgia ]
~ third ] i take the ` european parliament ] 's views as welcome input to the early stages of the ` ebrd ] 's ~ fourth ] capital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in % zagreb ] in @ may ]
faced with the dramatic decline in private flows of credit we came together last month with the ` world bank ] group to launch the joint ifi action plan in support of banking systems and lending to the real economy in * central and eastern europe ]
an increase of more than
~ first ] the context of the financial and economic crisis renders any encouragement of greater cooperation between ` ebrd ] and ` eib ] more relevant than ever
! twenty ] at the same time we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing
@ two thousand and ten ] the ` ebrd ] has taken a proactive stance in response to the crisis supporting our clients in countries of operations we are expanding our instruments and aim to invest ( eur seven billion ] in @ two thousand and nine ]
yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy driven aspiration but a vital necessity
the full implications of the current situation on our portfolio and on the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen
i believe it is in this context that we may find divisions of labour applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation including common standards which you have called for
that this kind of ifi cooperation born of need is the kind that works best
i refer in particular to the * western balkans ] investment framework now being launched as well as to the eastern partnership announced by the ` european council ] in @ recent days ] which will build on the good cooperation we have already established through our memorandum of understanding and the neighbourhood investment facility
the action plan recognises that an effective crisis response in * europe ] 's integrated financial markets requires fast and coordinated action by all stakeholders parent banks which own a large part of the region 's financial sectors
mr president what worries me most is the suggestion that the ` european investment bank ] has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis that it can somehow act as the * europe ] wide body to provide stimulus where member states have singularly failed to coordinate their own stimuli
i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks
the ` eib ] has a leverage of about ! thirty five ] times and its shareholders are member state governments
it would be a serious issue if it were to go bust like some of our commercial banks the report even encourages the ` eib ] and the commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments
the danger is that if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested then its enviable high credit rating may be downgraded like some of our governments
however i would stress that the commission has neither the capacity nor the desire to lead the delivery of the action plan itself
the implementation of an action plan will require real cooperation commitment and leadership from member states and regional stakeholders to deliver the ! eighty ] or so projects included at this stage
this rapid progress is important if we are to maintain momentum as we enter the implementation phase of the strategy
this is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the member states and other stakeholders
the commission very much expects ` parliament ] to be actively involved in events such as the annual forum
the ~ first ] formal assessment of progress made will be presented under the ) polish ] presidency in the ~ second ] ! half ] of
this will give all stakeholders an opportunity to consider how @ the first months ] of the strategy have gone and what lessons might already be drawn at that stage
the coordination monitoring and reporting is done by the commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the member states or organisations of the * baltic sea ] region
i would now like to say a few words about the planned governance system which is proposed for the operational implementation of the strategy
this is ! one ] area where there has been much discussion among the member states but the overall approach is that policy orientations will be taken by the ` council ]
the & baltic sea strategy ] has required a completely new approach from the ` european commission ] as it is the ~ first ] time that we have prepared an integrated strategy for a group of member states who have to face the same challenges and who may benefit from the same opportunities
in financial terms although there is no additional financing from the % eu ] budget the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and a more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the ` european investment bank ] or the ` nordic investment bank ]
of course it is not a complete surprise to me that parliament is taking such an interest in the strategy
@ two thousand and eleven ] however prior to that the ~ first ] annual forum of the & baltic sea strategy ] will take place @ next year ]
i would like to conclude by saying that i look forward to continuing to work closely with parliament on all aspects of strategy
the ) swedish ] presidency has led positive and constructive discussions in ` council ] which are to lead to conclusions already in @ october ]
here we expect to see a wave of coordination meetings to kick start the various priority areas and individual projects included in the action plan
responsibility must rest with the relevant member states and other stakeholders directly involved on the ground
your backing is crucial to maintain widespread visibility for the strategy to maintain high level political support for the strategy and to maintain pressure on the member states and the regional actors to deliver results
in addition the commission proposes to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties
i would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparatory work on the strategic framework that i have just described will count for nought unless we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the ground hence the importance of the strategy 's action plan which has also been drawn up during the preparatory work
the population of * europe ]
the majority are fed up with mass migration they do not want any more migrants and they want to send back those who are now here
we are on one side and on the other side there is the whole corrupt political elite the thing is that the majority of the citizens of * europe ] cannot really speak up because they are punished they are oppressed there are all these hate speech laws that silence people it is really strange that we are the
we do have freedom of speech and we speak up for the majority of the citizens of * europe ] but they should also speak up and they should support % hungary ] in our efforts
mr president could i say that the commissioner showed a good understanding of the construction industry
i would emphasise the need for more ce marking which is absolutely essential we do not want to see any more national standards and i wish this whole process every success for the future
all i would say is that i think it represents a larger percentage of overall gdp something like ! twelve ] or ! thirteen ] and of materials say ! four ] or ! five ] so it is a very important sector i am a civil engineer by background and it was a privilege to do the opinion on behalf of the
it is a very important measure in a very important industry
the construction industry does need a regulation after @ twenty years ] of having the directive in place
it is evident that gender equality must be mainstreamed in all policy responses to the crisis in all education and training policies in the ) european ] social fund and in other programmes so as to enable greater social integration through employment
i have in mind a council with a wider mandate covering all economic social environmental and human development in the world
now we should do the same in the % european union ]
i think that we should pay a lot of attention to development issues also in that report
for me personally the most important achievements in this report are the recommendations on the substantial strengthening of the economic social environmental and developmental dimensions of the ` un ] system
by developing it into a sustainable development council
mr president my report includes several proposals for strengthening the role of the ` united nations ] system in global governance and for improving the possibilities of the % european union ] and its member states to better achieve our foreign policy goals inside the system
these ideas got a lot of support in the negotiations but not enough in order to be accepted
i proposed that the ` council ] would have permanent members the % european union ] the % usa ] % japan ] and the brics countries and rotating ones
according to the report this must be done in the first instance by means of structural and functional reform of the ` economic and social council ] but we also call on the % eu ] institutions and member states to consider the possibility of strengthening their role in the ` ecosoc ]
chancellor } angela merkel ] proposed in a speech to the ` world economic council ] in % davos ] in @ two thousand and nine ] the creation of a ` un economic council ] according to the model of the ` un security council ]
in the negotiations on my euun report i felt that those who emphasise the importance of the security dimension of the ` united nations ] were reluctant to strengthen the other parts of the ` un ] system
we do appreciate the own resources although we would have wanted to have more ambitious own resources
we 've made an agreement in the framework of the ` united nations ] and it 's called sdgs and in your introduction mr commissioner neither you or } juncker ] mentioned the stgs and i think it 's so extremely important that we use this budget to make sure that all the money that we spend in all these sectors is used to come up with good results on the sustainable development goals
} oleg sentsov ] 's case is no longer just a judicial or political one
it is now a matter of human compassion
he should be immediately and unconditionally released on humanitarian grounds
to protect smes and to minimise bureaucracy and red tape the regulation offers an exemption for the smallest importers based on a threshold system designed to cover at least ! ninety five ] of all imports to the % european union ]
all industry initiatives have to fully comply with the international ` oecd ] due diligence guidelines elaborated to help companies respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict financing
the vicious circle has now been broken
stability in * africa ] and all other conflict areas means fewer migration flows to the % european union ]
educating the stakeholders and achieving long term sustainable effects is only possible through an approach based on shared responsibility
now we just have to implement this regulation
we believe that legal trade is good and that trade is meant to sustain jobs and prosperity for people and for communities
there is ! one ] thing that i believe we can do immediately distinguished colleagues @ tomorrow ] we can show the determination of the ` european parliament ] to ensure a clean and sustainable mineral supply chain
we have hammered out an effective and workable regulation now let us show everybody that we are determined to make this ~ first ] step
received almost ! one million ] refugees from neighbouring countries
to allow international investigation on the killings of protesters on government sponsored land grabs
and to provide unrestricted access for human rights organisations and ngos to all parts of the country
our resolution lists several names journalists ! one ] line activists who are kept in detention
tool in a pilot already
who can explain this way of acting
@ next year ] we go to the citizens
so we want to hear clearly what the commission is willing to do
we talk in this house about performance based budgeting
in @ two thousand and twenty one ] @ twenty two ] @ twenty three ] how can i explain to my voters that * europe ] delivers that * europe ] has better regulation that * europe ] has an open ear and delivers where companies and schools
so this is the question the ` regi committee ] wants to bring forward and i hope that you can come with at least a clear message because it was so silent it was too silent
~ second ] depending on the outcome of any such anticipated performance review is the commission willing to release the performance reserves earlier
we have our elections we did our negotiating in the year @ two thousand and thirteen ] in @ two thousand and fourteen ] we started
and ! sixteen ] @ two thousand and seventeen ] @ two thousand and eighteen ] and now we have to wait until @ two thousand and nineteen ] to have an evaluation and then this money that 's already in the envelope of the member states can be committed to be spent later
so we have to speak
in this context i support the idea of drawing * latin america ] and * africa ] more deeply into the existing transatlantic dialogue it is sometimes said that the % eu ] faces the choice between tightening our strategic partnership with the % us ] or working towards more flexible coalitions with other players such as % south africa ] or % brazil ]
but it is a false choice
it is about time that the ` european council ] did its part of the job
we ~ first ] heard % ireland ] a veteran @ forty five years ] in the % european union ] and now we have % croatia ] the newest accession
many of us here are convinced that * europe ] the % european union ] has been in a protracted crisis dragging its feet and hounded by nationalists populists and europhobes and do you know what
it is about a lack of vision to face in a ) european ] fashion the % eurozone ] needs globalisation and most notably the refugee crisis
is completely different
@ two thousand and fourteen ] @ two thousand and twenty ] will the experience of @ two thousand and fourteen ] @ two thousand and sixteen ] be repeated
this renewed policy definitively leads to more local and ) european ] added value
and clarifying the effects of the late start for the @ next years ] ` n three ] will lead to performance payments in the @ years until ]
the ex ante conditionalities we have formulated lead to a more integrated policy and a better structured and targeted result
it was something new in this house
we need a new payment plan until
we see commitments in the social field especially for younger people to bring them to a job
@ two thousand and twenty three ] i ask you to include ! three ] aspects in this cohesion master plan taking away the hindrances to the expenditure in the member states
member states were still working to finalise the programmes and came with very late agreed programmes for the new period
the practical reflection and the relation with the ) european ] semester is established cohesion concerns ! three fourths ] of the country specific recommendations and we made a performance framework as an example as i said of this
@ tomorrow ] this house will agree on a resolution
in the resolution is a clear request without any doubt and you could also hear it @ today ] that you want to have a master plan on acceleration and this is not a theoretical thing
and this means that you look and tell us honestly what does it mean if you start @ three years ] later
mr president this is just to say that i thought my name would be among the signatures on this resolution
@ two thousand and sixteen ] the ` council ] protects and supports the budget for instruments that spur growth and thereby create jobs namely such instruments as efsi cosme erasmus and others
concerning subheading ! one ] b economic social and territorial cohesion which is another core policy of the % european union ] for the creation of growth and jobs the ` council ] proposes limited reductions of payment appropriations on new programmes of ( eur one hundred and ninety nine million ]
@ two thousand and sixteen ] the ` council ] has accepted in full all appropriations destined for the programmes and agencies dealing with the crisis including the use of the flexibility instrument for an amount of ( eur five hundred and thirty million ] and the contingency margin for an amount of eur
! five ] frankly the ` council ] and the member states are very concerned to note that not all institutions will achieve that goal therefore the ` council ] has made it very clear in a statement that it expects that all efforts will be deployed to avoid any additional delays in implementing this jointly agreed reduction target
this means that we wish to finance adequately investments to spur growth and jobs for example through the european fund for strategic investments and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the still ongoing migration crisis and the related external policies
so you can see that the ` council ] stands fully behind the } european ] agenda on migration as was agreed between us in
@ two thousand and sixteen ] programmes and instruments related to the migration crisis and the facility for refugees in % turkey ] were not affected by reductions
that deadlock should be fully resolved @ by the end of this year ] in accordance with the payment plan
global europe the ` council ] undertook a thorough analysis in order to identify space for creating the necessary margin since the commission 's proposal for @ two thousand and seventeen ] has completely exhausted the margin for commitments
i would like to begin by stating clearly that the main thrust of the ` council ] 's position is the prioritisation of expenditure
in conclusion as you can see in an effort to find the right balance between on the one hand a sustainable budget in times of budgetary constraints throughout * europe ] and on the other hand financing essential political priorities the council has identified areas where savings are reasonable and necessary
in those areas that cannot be qualified as top political priorities in the current circumstances reductions in the proposal of the commission have been made in a careful fashion in order not to harm programmes that perform well and are coming up to speed
& subheading one a ] however has also contributed to the general savings effort concerning some budget lines where the ` council ] considers following a detailed technical analysis that the commission has overestimated the real needs
i think the discussion showed that we may have some different views but in general we are united by the fact that we want to have a workable budget a good budget for ) european ] citizens
for @ two thousand and seventeen ] and we want to keep the main focus of these discussions on the @ two thousand and seventeen ] budget
* europe ] can survive in the global economy only as a competitive economy
if i may just very briefly address some of the important points which were made during the discussion
i am also looking forward to our cooperation
! one ] of the issues or challenges we have is that we have too many priorities and too little money and the question is how to use the money in the best possible way
all the people have to feel our assistance
we have to stop all supplies of military equipment to the undemocratic governments in the region
of course we have to be very careful not to support the forces and movements with islamist ideology
we have to have a united * europe ] in position
@ last week ] on @ ten september two thousand and nine ] the commission adopted a communication on stepping up international climate finance which aims at speeding up the international negotiations
in this respect it is worth mentioning the global partnership on technology which aims at doubling investment in low carbon technologies
with ! two hundred and fifty ] pages of negotiating text on the table the negotiations have not yet gathered sufficient momentum to come to an agreement that is ambitious and detailed enough
however among most parties there is a sense of urgency and the willingness to focus on areas of convergence
money will make or break the deal we need to mobilise private investment and promote the establishment of a robust international carbon market but substantial public funding will also be required
furthermore we have to strengthen support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of climate change
there is a daunting task ahead of us with intense negotiations over @ the coming months ] but failure is not an option
we need comparable and more ambitious emission reduction targets for the group of developed countries which in aggregate today offer less than ! fifteen ] reduction as compared with
and it is not only that it is also the other cars that have been cheating and the differences in the different member states such as some of them are mandatory others are voluntary some are only for the national car market and others are different
how will you do that
we also have to look to the future and yes we have to care about our car industry but a new era is coming it will be electrified it will be sharing mobility and if we do not make sure that we do that for our industry if we do not make sure that we have a ! zero ] emissions mandate then cars will be imported from % china ] and elsewhere in the world and our car industry will have big problems as will these ! millions ] of people
! three million ] cars have not been recalled yet
how will the commission make sure that all consumers in * europe ] have the same rights
we cannot actually restrict access to the % eu ] market for them which could be a consequence of such extensive regulation
so excessive regulation could really harm the economies of the developing world and could actually cost jobs there
@ ten weeks ago ] the & stabilisation and association agreement ] entered into force
! one ] political development is that reducing corruption and organised crime and making the judiciary more efficient has been assessed as good by the commission
a lot has already been said about the magnitude of these rights violations and about the relevance of the topic trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed with a human rights based and victim centred approach
victims and vulnerable populations need to be put at the centre of all efforts
the prevention of trafficking in human beings and the protection of its victims must be our priority goal
access to justice support measures shelter and education needs to be ensured independent of the victims willingness to cooperate in criminal proceedings
the principle of non criminalisation in this regard is also vital and needs to be implemented in all member states
further demand needs to be tackled as it can be considered a root cause
accountability needs to be ensured for both offenders as well as knowing users
for the new strategy i think that financial investigations and action against money laundering need to play a bigger part in fighting trafficking in human beings and to ensure that confiscated assets are used to support and compensate victims of trafficking
does the commission agree on this and how does it intend to address this in the new strategy
i am also worried about the trend of trafficking in human beings being mixed up with other legally distinct concepts such as migrant smuggling increasingly addressing trafficking in human beings through a security lens for instance in the context of recent migration policies
how will the commission counter this trend in its new strategy
i also call for greater internal external coherence in the fight against trafficking in human beings and to further enhance and deepen cooperation and coordination among all relevant actors
that would give enlargement a more prominent presence supplementing the usual progress reports for the countries
therefore i sincerely welcome the commission strategy and the action plan as documents which will officially and permanently put * western balkan ] enlargement back on the ) european ] agenda
it also became clear that we simply cannot wait for all major political issues to be settled before we endeavour to have further enlargement
all this could provide a strong political backdrop for the difficult work that lies ahead on all sides in order to welcome the frontrunner countries % serbia ] and % montenegro ] as full members in
additionally i would call on the commission to draw up annual reports concerning the implementation of this strategy and the action plan which should be discussed here in plenary
it is important not just for the countries of the region but also for the % european union ] itself without providing a credible prospect of full membership for all the countries of the * western balkans ] the % eu ] global role will not be credible because this is our region this is our ~ first ] commitment
we need to invest more both politically and financially yes it is a difficult process because enlargement is a joint effort
but at the same time there is always an alternative that we should not forget and the alternative is embracing nationalism and populism and creating rivalries and hostilities again
where there is a will there is always a way and @ last year ] the % republic of macedonia ] made tremendous progress towards realising that ) european ] perspective
public violence and hate speech against lgbti people in % egypt ] are rampant and increasing and we have reports on that
to say that we are passing on the message mr commissioner is just not enough you don 't pass on the message about human rights you demand that human rights be respected
we need a different kind of partnership
but @ today ] i want to raise the specific situation of lgbti persons being persecuted
it is also a question of when the authorities perpetrate this kind of violence
we are ready for more concrete cooperation in this field and the partnership priorities are giving us the opportunity to explore new forms of common engagement
this was the ~ first ] # association council ] with % egypt ] in @ seven years ] so the ~ first ] since the beginning of the revolts in the ) arab ] world
mr president the ` ecr group ] recognises the practical value of regional development funding and supports efforts to ensure it is spent more efficiently this sixth report clearly calls for more to be done there it is not a clean bill of health
i and others in the group are not wholly convinced that there is as full an understanding as there should be this funding is not a revenue substitute nor is it intended to be for more than @ a third of a century ] as has been the case
furthermore i do not believe that part of the agenda behind the in other respects unobjectionable urban policy is desirable either especially and i quote to improve the democratic legitimacy of the ) european ] project
best practice and cooperation yes
i welcome those elements
mr president control free or check free travel within the frontiers of the * schengen area ] is a basic principle and ! one ] of the greatest achievements of the % european union ] although recent tragic events have indeed put & schengen ] to the test
their travel documents are checked at the official checkpoints while not all other ) european ] citizens have to undergo such monitoring
while we must do our best in order to provide security for everyone under current circumstances such discrimination and unjustified violation of the & schengen agreement ] is both unacceptable and unreasonable
this is exactly the aim of the # european year of citizens two thousand and thirteen ] to mark the ~ twentieth ] anniversary of the establishment of % union ] citizenship by the & treaty of maastricht ] and to give a new momentum to the debate on % union ] citizenship
as members of the ` european parliament ] the only directly elected % eu ] institution we have a crucial role to play in promoting the aims of the # european year of citizens two thousand and thirteen ] by bridging the gap between % brussels ] and member states communicating the rights and benefits of % eu ] citizenship endorsing citizens concerns in formulating % eu ] policies and promoting participative democracy
to enjoy protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any member state in a ~ third ] country
all % eu ] citizens must be informed and enjoy without discrimination all the rights granted to them by % union ] law and the & charter of fundamental rights ] i
in view of the forthcoming ) european ] elections we must raise awareness of the legislative powers of the ` european parliament ] and encourage citizens to vote so that their voice is heard clearly by ) eu ] decision makers
to address the institutions of the % union ] to enjoy the free movement of goods and services consumer protection public health equal opportunities equal treatment access to employment and social protection to enjoy the new right of the european citizens initiative granted by the & lisbon treaty ] and to strengthen participative democracy through access to documents information good governance and administration
at a time of economic political and social crisis only @ twenty months before ] the next # european elections ] putting % union ] citizenship and participative democracy at the centre of the political agenda is absolutely essential
to petition the ` european parliament ]
that we need to support ` easo ] in order that people arriving can have their asylum application properly proceed
the ~ second ] point is that we have to change the nomenclature of the amif budget lines because putting integration and return together in ! one ] budget line is just avoiding being clear on where the money is being spent
but of course we have some questions on details these are matters of tremendous political importance that we need to debate
i also wonder why ` europol ] should receive the same increase in funding and staff as ` easo ]
so you had a very energy efficient aeroplane and then it could fly on solar
development was lifted to an equal footing with diplomacy and defence
we have to fight against poverty and promote ecologically economically and socially sustainable development all over the world
in development policy we have to act in close cooperation with the % united states ] since in this field our basic values goals and interests are very close to each other
this is also how we can most effectively tackle the root causes of our recent security and migration challenges
saying a firm no to fgm for me also means that we have to have protective laws and we have to provide strong support to the grassroots organisations that work on this
this is a simple three d print that i think every woman should be proud to be in possession of because knowing your body is also a way to take back control to take back power
@ today ] we see the attacks on women 's bodies from the likes of } trump ] with his awful gag rule that wants to threaten women 's sexual and reproductive health and rights worldwide
we say no to all forms of patriarchal control over our bodies and we say yes to sexual freedom and choice for women and for proper sexuality education where we can learn about our rights our women 's rights and our bodies and about the clitoris
it has nothing to do with religion but it has all to do with patriarchy
these struggles are linked
many people don 't even know what it looks like and the dictionaries in @ two thousand and seventeen ] still get it wrong
it is also symptomatic for me that the clitoris almost everywhere has been systematically neglected and erased
we say no to fgm support grassroots organisations
as colleagues have said approximately ! one hundred and thirty ] to ! one hundred and forty million ] women and girls have been victims of fgm fgm is older than ) christianity ] or ) islam ]
this is being used by many fgm activists that fight against fgm and it gives us the power to protect it
colleagues commission our message must be clear
but saying no to fgm also demands that we say no to all forms of patriarchal control of our bodies
in @ past years ] all our attention was focused on the lowering of co two emissions and particulate matter without devoting enough attention to nox
with the new proposal we are introducing new real driving emissions tests that are closest to real world use and we will also introduce new type approval legislation that will help diesel cars to become much cleaner but we do not need new agencies for that
we should use this period to prepare new development plans focusing on new innovative technologies in order to safeguard * europe ] 's position as the ~ number one ] car maker in the world
we need stronger rules that will effectively deal with the emission problems for diesel cars
for the upcoming years the classic technologies based on fossil fuels and the alternative solutions will be present side by side
but at the same time there is still some disappointing information
as the rapporteur has stated we tackled very important topics like fake news whistle blowers geo blocking and licences always defending freedom of expression which is the crucial and the central point of our concern
and now we have a decision that for the first time in this ` parliament ] has been rejected by all the political groups and all the committees with a huge majority almost unanimity
i almost feel sorry for the commission
madam president it is hard to believe that we are sitting here today discussing minor changes to the rules on value added tax when % eu ] countries are facing the worst financial and economic crisis since the # great depression ]
no doubt the gestures towards % european union ] will continue but democratically elected governments have a primary interest in looking after the populations that elected them
never mind that prudent government finances are essential to the survival of the euro there is nothing else that these countries can do about their budgets
probably of even more serious concern is the huge exposure of several * euro zone ] countries to defaulting debts of * eastern europe ]
i therefore ask the commission to urge the implementation of a local primary health strategy to embrace a healthy lifestyle awareness campaigns and the early introduction of screening programmes across * europe ] so that we can meet our goals of healthy ageing by @ two thousand and twenty ]
bearing in mind the guidelines for colorectal cancer screening from @ two thousand and ten ] @ last week ] i hosted the conference which launched a white paper setting the standards for the prevention diagnosis treatment and care of colorectal cancer across * europe ]
if we take so long with a rule of law country like % singapore ] imagine how long we will take with bigger more problematic countries
with cyber criminals getting better at breaking into protected networks i strongly believe that the only real way to win the battle is to have people with similar knowledge and expertise fighting against them
mr president even though i thought i got your message that i should not ask for the floor i will do it anyway
i think that it is actually a fundamental right to have a basic bank account
governments feel the scepticism of public opinion and try to transfer responsibility to the commission
the % eu ] is therefore in a hypocritical situation where the ` council ] does not approve gmos but some member states cultivate them
usually our group is a proponent of a community approach but in this particular case we should not have a ! one ] size fits all policy
the inclusion of complementary environmental reasons as well as a list of social and economic grounds for the restriction or prohibition of gmos by member states will make this report more legally solid
mr president any operator that is responsible for damage to the environment must be held accountable for their actions
however the determination of the accountability should be down to the member state
you mention the establishment of a secondary liability regime based upon the systems already adopted by several member states
this is typical of the % eu ] implementing more and more unnecessary legislation
the report calls for the consideration of a ) european ] fund for the remedying of environmental damage
so if you propose this fund who is going to pay for it
implementation of the ` council ] decision of @ twenty six april two thousand and four ] would greatly encourage % turkey ] to implement the & ec turkey association agreement ]
as meps i hope that we can send a strong message on behalf of those citizens that we are in favour of a free internet where the privacy of users and their rights are respected fully @ today ] we must stand behind the block of citizens amendments that have been tabled as the best way of defending those rights of our citizens
these amendments if passed will restore some sort of balance between end users rights and freedoms and the rights and freedoms of others including the right to intellectual property protection and indeed the right to privacy
the aim of this proposal should be to protect those who need protection but also to strengthen the rights of citizens to access information within the law when and where they see fit
service providers should be made to act in a transparent manner at all times and if in very exceptional cases restrictions to access are required they should be fully accountable in justifying these restrictions
national powers should have a role in investigating any restriction that service providers impose
mr president for the moment the cultural cleansing undertaken by ) daesh ] at other precious sites they have seized has not taken place at * palmyra ] one of the greatest of all cultural treasures of the * middle east ]
indeed the destruction of such sites is in fact contrary to ) islamic ] scholarship where previous civilisations and the learning and architecture of antiquity was studied preserved often incorporated and in a positive sense used
as my colleague } boris johnson ] the mayor of % london ] has put it this is not a clash of civilizations
as a former ` unesco world heritage site ] chairman myself the thought that this wondrous jewel could be destroyed concerns me and so many others deeply never forgetting that probably over ! one zero ] people have lost their lives in and around the site
! twenty two ] additionally separate votes on amendment nos twenty six thirty six forty six seventy one and
! eighty two ] they all concern the same issue that we have now lost so i propose that we vote all of this en bloc
member states because in the digital single market more and more personal data of people from ! one ] member state will be collected stored and used in other member states
they would have some effect but i think we need to pay attention to the loopholes
they collaborate supporting each other
so in this regard we really would like to see in future a much more proactive and cooperative role from the commission side otherwise it will be very difficult for us to cooperate
however madam commissioner there was a key measure missing from your proposal
a unique sense of ownership of the sea and its resources and a real form of rationalisation will be established i want to call upon all members of this ` parliament ] to give this measure some teeth and vote for & amendment two hundred and fifty three ] this is the main novel idea that ` parliament ]
this will allow us to restore levels of fish and increase the income of fishermen throughout the % european union ] by increasing both the quantity and the size of fish caught
i also would like to welcome the constitutional reform % albania ] has been successfully going through which is a very difficult task we all understand that but we also know that when it comes to judicial reform it is the implementation which is the most difficult and the most important task if % albania ] engages in this reform process according to its envisaged reform strategy we will be very satisfied with that
mr president i think that is a very reasonable question yes of course we cannot only use market based instruments
i think we should also use other instruments such as regulation for instance
we have just adopted an energy efficiency directive that will definitely also point us in the right direction
but because this is a huge massive problem there needs to be a fundamental change in the way we consume and produce energy
so we need to use what we have now and that is the ets system
you probably know how busy we are
@ four thousand days and nights ] @ nearly eleven years ]
i am a recent participant in the [ twitter ] site and i have to say that i am more than surprised and impressed at how much information is on that site from the % european union ] it gives a huge amount of information and i would like to congratulate them on that
i am sure that this quest for freedom is universal and that the % eu ] has a moral obligation and a strategic interest to avoid more tragedies in the * mediterranean ] by promoting peace security and the rule of law in a firmer and more assertive way in the countries of origin
while she was thankful for reaching the free world she became really happy only when her homeland was finally freed from oppression and we eventually came back to % croatia ]
we know that there is a shortage of skilled labour in this area at the same time there are a lot of people who will lose their jobs and will need retraining
we hope that we will go all together
the & dsa ] must improve the framework for digital service providers to stimulate growth but it must also make the fight against illegal content more successful and it must improve transparency and oversight
either we develop ai based on our own values and with economic benefits or we end up using ai developed on other continents without those values and without a large part of the economic benefits
a strong riskbased approach offers the best way forward here these challenges are difficult but i fully support the efforts of all the rapporteurs here @ today ] we are not even close to a satisfying legal situation but these reports are an excellent start
and some people born in a different time like myself might want to go back to how it was before because it seems like a simpler time
the future will be more digital not less and it brings incredible progress that we as policymakers should embrace
also brings dangers that we cannot ignore anymore
let us be honest with each other colleagues the % eu ] has done more to regulate the online world than any other continent
over @ the past decades ] we have not followed up on illegal content and illegal activities online with the same rigour as we have illegal activities offline
we have not achieved any meaningful transparency over how algorithms push content to users on a massive scale
we have not grasped the impact of it on our democracies our culture and our fundamental rights
instead we have focused on voluntary cooperation which is good but not good enough
not nearly good enough
we cannot leave this to the private sector without oversight and enforcement we must keep this in the public debate as a priority and we must regulate no matter how technical these files are
the difficult challenge before us is to find the balance between digital progress and respect for fundamental rights
the value of lawmaking is the real change it effects
if we start off with conflicting regulations and directives that undermine each other instead of complementing each other we have lost the battle before it starts
we must respect the scope of each digital file
~ secondly ] the fundamentals of the & e commerce directive ] were great but its greatest issue was transparency
we must improve and enforce meaningful transparency and i call for a clear mandate from this ` parliament ]
~ thirdly ] we all agree on the importance of notice and action mechanisms to remove illegal content online but this places the burden almost entirely on users we therefore should complement notice and action with clear and appropriate obligations to remove illegal content and it 's the public authorities who should provide the funding to follow up on this
finally i would like of course personally to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all my colleagues on the ` libe ] & dsa ] report for their excellent cooperation
they established some priorities
to our children and young people we have to partner titles on theoretical topics with above all practical values
indeed education and culture have to do with civilisation
golden visas have a negative impact on the status of ) eu ] residence and citizenship
let me outline briefly what the commission is already doing to improve its implementation
we are worried by the deteriorating situation when it comes to respect for human rights persecution of political opponents and journalists is becoming a rule in this country full of contrast a country which is on the one hand incredibly rich in oil and diamonds and on the other hand has ! one ] of the highest rates of child mortality in the world
it is the corrupt elites who are depriving the people of % angola ] of their basic human rights access to healthcare food and education by stealing public money intended for basic social services we are seriously concerned about the possible mismanagement of % eu ] development funds by the local authorities and in this regard we are asking the commission to review the national indicative programme under the ~ eleventh ] edf and to ensure that good governance respect for human rights and the fight against corruption are the main financing priorities for this fabulously rich country which suffers also from a fabulously corrupt elite
mr president after @ decades ] of conflict and instability % angola ] continues to face the major challenges of weak governance human rights abuses and widespread corruption
however it should be a decision taken by the % eu ] as a whole and of course coordinated with the % us ] % turkey ] and the ` arab league ]
it is important that ` facebook ] is not only relying on ads as they say is their business model but is also delivering for trust by delivering solutions and actions in the way of how they do their business model
but i would also agree it is very important to understand that there is a missing brick in this wall and that is the e privacy regulation
we need to get more rules in place especially also for consumer control to get connectivity across the platforms in order to have a choice
the business model of just earning money by using the data of individuals has to change because that 's not only ` facebook ] 's business model
we still need to fix that problem because the communication data needs to be protected in a specific way
we can be very proud as the % european union ] and especially as ` parliament ] that we have a tool to protect the privacy and integrity of our citizens lives with the & gdpr ] in place
it 's about fundamental rights privacy awareness but privacy enforcement as well namely the right to be forgotten enshrined by the & gdpr ]
but it is also about democracy because fake news is a hybrid war of intoxication manipulation lies and hate speech aimed to weaken democracy through interfering in elections and enhancing populism and europhobia so it takes a ) european ] response which means that no member state can do it on its own before a giant in the internet like ` facebook ] but also legal binding and effective law but it takes action that means that doing nothing is not a choice
that is what the ) european ] citizens are expecting from all of us and that is precisely and exactly what we ask from you
the ` european commission ] must take initiative action and now
upholding these values is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the % european union ] because they guarantee that member states fulfil their international law obligations and that they can trust each other and the institutions of the % european union ]
the % european union ] was founded on the principles of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights
failing to do so may have severe consequences including the possibility of the % european union ] falling apart @ almost sixty years ] have passed since its foundation
right before our eyes
this report also has other important implications for the fundamental rights of minorities ) roma ] children women and lgbti people and for those seeking asylum
this has been proved in the @ last couple of years ] and must be rectified that is why in this report we call for a new mechanism that is automatically triggered in cases of breaches of fundamental values and rights to remedy the breaches to avoid the materialisation of systematic threats in member states our common ) european ] fundamental values are being threatened ~ first ] and foremost from within
too narrow a focus means that we will be missing some targets
too many mandates at the same time can lead to fragmentation and to high costs
we should keep finding the right balance and finding the tradeoffs to be focused and efficient in the work and the ` eib ]
this can be done through various programmes and the exchange of best practices and know how and by assuring the availability of necessary funding for education training awareness raising and empowerment for women as well as for the continuous fight against gender violence stereotypes and discrimination
it is about jobs and it is about money
i understand that we are involved in a big legal battle with % norway ] and i believe that we can find enough good lawyers to win this battle
it is about ) european ] citizens trust in the ` european commission ] and institutions
let me give you a few examples
madam president i have listened carefully to the debate @ today ] and i am encouraged by the engagement of the members of this house
we need to speak about gender equality and we need to counteract racism xenophobia and islamophobia
i was in the arrivals hall waiting to go out through customs when we heard and felt the first explosion
no rifles or surveillance technology in the world can do that
then the ~ second ] explosion came and some of us thought that the roof was coming down upon us
my body remembers that fear and it is in that feeling that i reject those who say that we have to learn to live with this terrorism is manmade and we can undo it
it is time to step back for a moment to just pause and think through the implications of our actions until now
are we taking the right measures to invest massively in better equipment better cooperation between our police and security services and effective deradicalisation or are we still putting forward expensive but ineffective and symbolic measures of mass data collection or intrusive surveillance measures against completely innocent citizens
thereby weakening effective security and our freedoms together which we defend
therefore i am very happy that commissioner } king ] is starting to investigate the effectiveness of the ! hundreds ] of security measures which the % european union ] and its member states have adopted through the years
if this is what you are calling for then welcome back into * europe ]
however the most offensive position that you have taken is the proposal that % spain ] will have the right to veto any # brexit ] deal over the issue of % gibraltar ]
i do however have a solution to prevent % gibraltar ] being used as a pawn in # brexit ] negotiations and indeed end ) spanish ] claims once and for all make % gibraltar ] a fully integrated part of the % uk ]
i have been calling for this for @ many many years ] and with the unique opportunities that # brexit ] has given us i believe it is an idea whose time has come
give % gibraltar ] real influence and a voice in % westminster ] and send a clear message that % gibraltar ] is not for sale
give her and our other overseas territories their own member of parliament
in this area we the % uk ] can learn from our continental cousins because the ) french ] give representation to their overseas territories and i propose that we should too
this i guarantee would cause immense damage to the economies of the % european union ] and would result in putting many of your citizens out of work it is what we call in the % uk ] cutting off your nose to spite your face
i want to make it clear in this chamber @ today ] that the people of % gibraltar ] are proudly ) british ] in @ two thousand and two ] ! ninety nine ] of ) gibraltarians ] voted in a referendum against shared sovereignty with % spain ] and the wishes of the people should be upheld
~ first ] our position our attitude as committed pro ) europeans ] is very well described in ? hamlet ] when } horatio ] describes the expression of the father of } hamlet ] a countenance more in sorrow than in anger that will be our attitude in our negotiation
i will just underline ! four ] ideas that seem to me of the utmost importance on the subject
however it is a step that should not be taken lightly
for me as an mep the effects of climate change on the rights of indigenous people are really very close to my heart because the warming climate is the direct or indirect cause of many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of that
budget consolidation needs to be complemented by a social investment strategy that will address the social employment and education targets of the eu two thousand and twenty strategy
not only have i had no answer but his office refused to respond to my e mails
gender diversity on boards leads to more sustainable decisions and therefore to a more resistant ) european ] economy
i would therefore like to stress again the importance of reaching ~ first ] reading agreement on an issue which is so important to % european union ] citizens
% estonia ] has chosen ! four ] main objectives for the @ next six months ]
the logical order of these ! four ] objectives seems clear the inclusive and sustainable * europe ] that % estonia ] wants to promote as the ~ fourth ] objective will be closer if the ~ first ] ! three ] objectives are achieved
these ! three ] goals may certainly facilitate a more inclusive and sustainable * europe ]
i am confident and convinced that in @ the months to come ] % estonia ] will go in the direction of denouncing any breach of fundamental rights in the % european union ]
i question the validity of & reach ] to do so because so far we have not restricted ! one ] single substance using the & reach ] system
so that was my question if it is really appropriate and if it will work
let me say that such a policy shift would be a strategic blunder the % eu ] should continue to do what it is doing only do it better
therefore i would say that recent events in % russia ] and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying the course in terms of our policy
% iran ] sees some of its citizens as threats repression happens to real people people with family and friends
so my question is basically what is the commission doing to prevent the execution of these innocent people who only dream of democracy and freedom
and since the ) iranian ] options are limited and their cash flow is limited and their foreign currencies are limited they might very well offer as a quid pro quo naval bases or air bases to ) russian ] or ) chinese ] military in the * middle east ] and this is of course all bad news very bad news for anyone living in % israel ] in % lebanon ] in % yemen ] but also in the % european union ]
as coordinator for the & jcpoa ] which we fully support and also as a diplomatic success from the % european union ] i would ask you in the @ next eleven days ] and beyond to do your utmost best
i admit most rivals are dependent on who makes the decisions in the @ beginning of next year ] in % washington ] but right now in the next couple of months we have an expiring weapons embargo and there is no movement from the % usa ] to be expected which creates a daunting challenge i must say to try to restrain and limit arms sales to % iran ] and here lies a task for * europe ] and i was very pleased to learn that a while ago that ) european ] efforts to restrain to limit or at least to delay arms sales to % iran ] within the & p fifty one ] framework
any alternative means to find a solution is welcome because % beijing ] will sell its arms
are we still on the same page
are talks with % europe ] with % beijing ] and % moscow ] ongoing can you assure me that we are doing everything that we can to restrain
the ) iranian ] foreign minister has welcomed it and @ eleven days from now ] like the ` islamic revolutionary guard corps ] has said a new phase in military cooperation between % iran ] and the world will commence
debates however seem to be concentrating on whoever gets the ticket in the ` white house ]
is there still hope to limit arms sales
there is no way other than a peaceful solution out of this long ongoing conflict international peace needs to be an international endeavour
it is therefore absolutely unacceptable that countries such as % turkey ] for example contribute with mercenaries among other things to worsen the situation even more the % eu ] is a region built on the idea that dialogue is the only way forward for long lasting peace it is our duty at the same time to take leadership for those ideas in our neighbouring countries
i am glad that the international community is ready to assist and the % eu ] needs to support the ongoing process in the ` osce ]
that is what we have to improve and i really appreciate that you are taking this on your agenda and i would really see that member states are supporting you in making better use of these systems
so yes in the beginning of this huge transition we will still need fossil fuels and therefore % eu ] policies should support carbon capture enable government support schemes for blue hydrogen and i expect the commission to move forward in this direction in its energy summer package
no our biggest problem is that the perfect is becoming the enemy of the good
in infrastructure in the scale up of electrolysers but also in carbon capture utilisation and storage because we need to be realistic
well altogether that is not a sustainable posture
but luckily there 's ! one ] technology we all agree on that has the potential to decarbonise at least our heavy industries and transport hydrogen
we have @ thirty years ] to reshape our entire energy system and we can do it and we will fail if we demand to be perfect but we will definitely succeed by doing it as good as we can
and just look at the political debates no nuclear energy please no carbon capture that entails fossil fuels no biomass no gas in a transition no windmills in my backyard and no solar panels on agricultural grounds please
how can we possibly be serious in reaching our climate goals without technologies like carbon capture biomass or nuclear
it might not be a silver bullet but we all agree this energy carrier has enormous potential and our aim is clear to create a new clean produced green hydrogen market and a longterm certainty for all parties involved and that requires massive investments
if we want to pave the way for clean hydrogen we will initially need to invest in transitional technologies and these might not be perfect but they are good
welcoming criminals into our % european union ] with open arms just because those criminals are rich is totally outrageous and means forfeiting that trust because regardless of what the ) cypriot ] ) maltese ] ) bulgarian ] or any other government thinks access
to ! one ] % eu ] country 's passport also means access to the whole % eu ] with all the benefits that it takes @ years ] for normal people to enjoy even though they might have been exemplary inhabitants
this is not having sincere cooperation nor is it upholding the integrity of what % eu ] citizenship should mean convicted oligarchs and corrupt businessmen have nothing to do here in the % eu ]
my ~ second ] question is also why doesn 't it include all the countries who have this kind of system in place referring to the infringement process of course
in this respect we welcome all efforts to maintain common safety standards to put in place vigorous protection measures strict controls and training in safety procedures as well as to enforce regular risk assessments and preventive measures by employers
we should not be hypercritical clinging formally to the letter of the treaty and taking it as an excuse to look away from the real situation
they hinder the delivery of tangible benefits for our citizens and pose problems for those wishing to live work or do business across borders it is time to put people at the heart of % eu ] policy making by identifying problematic areas dismantling barriers to citizens and improving implementation in ways which result in concrete benefits in the daily lives of our citizens
they are harming competition they are creating unfair ways of increasing inequality
maybe most of them are actually legal but they matter not only because in the view of many people they are immoral they matter because they are harming our society
we can not only lead by example but more decisively use soft and hard powers to persuade the others that are making the game unfair
and in some cases do not be afraid to go for harmonisation
this is the moment where i have to turn to the finance ministers because they have the power
much to be worried about persecution of opposition and journalists and therefore i think the % eu ] has to stand up first for ) european ] values and condition enhanced cooperation on convincing progress in the field of human rights
that is evident from the recently leaked cables with one participant stating that it was impressive to see how some member states presented themselves outwardly as proponents of tax reform and at the same time to watch in the ` code of conduct group ] how they actually behave in % eu ] discussions protected by confidentiality
i actually listen to my constituents and i know they are furious about tax dodging by both businesses and individuals
as i said there is no room for complacency and many things have to be done
ahead of the meeting as we know some % eu ] leaders voiced concerns about external destabilising influences on the region and these have been mentioned again @ tonight ]
i believe our response has to be ever more visible and strong engagement in the region to support those forces that fight for human rights and the rule of law
the % eu ] is a peace project a project that aims to end frequent and bloody wars between neighbours horrible experiences that the * western balkans ] know only too well
the prospect of ) european ] integration for % montenegro ] and the * western balkans ] is therefore essential for peace in the region and across * europe ]
as the commissioner noted % montenegro ] continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to % eu ] integration
its steady progress in opening chapters is not only bringing it closer to % eu ] accession but as many others have said is also providing a positive example for other countries in the region
my group tabled a number of amendments to the report specifically focused on enhancing human rights
i am pleased that many of these are reflected in the report covering topics from ensuring media freedom to improving working conditions for civil society to better arrangements for victims of gender based violence to eliminating obstacles to health care education housing and employment for ) roma ] people
i am referring to that because we are at a crossroads
i think the fast track the commission and ` parliament ] are now attributing is an achievement because its bottom up
a ~ second ] issue which is important and also an achievement for ` parliament ] is that we are reflecting on the fact that we are living in an ever changing innovation environment it 's new it 's fast it 's ambitious it 's driven by vc capital and it 's competitive
but we failed
we want to tackle children 's cancer
for the ~ first ] time we don 't fight the fight between co two reduction and competitiveness we just focus on energy production what we are going to say is yes it 's not a contradiction both to do co two reduction and to be competitive but we have to do something about that and that is to focus on manufacturing we want to have co two free steel plants
we are leading but we have to do something about that leadership and we want to have a quantum computer @ ten years from now ]
it 's not for soapbox speeches it 's not for the sake of academic life it is about the substance of the well being of this continent
the reason for the well being of this continent relates starting in the @ eighteenth century ] to its ability to innovate
this is the continent which is open to the world
we don 't want to have an % america ] first like the % united states ]
are we fast enough in the international context
the historic legacy of the enlightenment is very much related to that
we are not naive but we want to ask the world to work together with us
it 's a game changer that we have more of a bottom up approach
we want to have more ambition but we want to align co two reduction and competition
i think what 's important to understand is that this is not just another programme that it is ! one ] of the biggest contributions to the ) european ] economy but also to the well being of ) european ] citizens
i think what we are going to achieve with that programme is ~ first ] of all going back and tackling the big challenges which are related to the ordinary life of citizens
in terms of technology we want to have a quantum computer
if you 're a researcher if you 're an innovator if you 're smart if you 're innovative you can go to the commission and say in the framework of what has been decided in the programme do we get funding
we owe to the labour of our working population in * europe ] but the basis of our well being is innovation
by the % dprk ] on a ) south korean ] island
we also expect % china ] to clearly condemn this act
there have been severe casualties among the ) south korean ] military and especially among the civilian population of that island
we welcome that baroness } ashton ] the high representative has acted in a concerned manner with other international actors our allies and our strategic partner the % republic of korea ] in condemning this clear violation of the ` un ] & korean armistice agreement ]
we call upon the % dprk ] to avoid any further escalation and to undertake all necessary efforts to maintain peace and stability on the * korean peninsula ]
such prevention presupposes major commitment as well as sustained and concerted efforts by the commission by the national governments of countries experiencing such phenomena by civil society international agencies and other stakeholders
and stereotypes against women preventing them from fully enjoying equal treatment in employment and educational opportunities in many countries
this is a rising but under reported problem in several countries
you know what i am talking about
but even worse than those ! billions ] is the frustration and anger when a tourist an artist and we love them we proved this @ today ] a company proprietor or a worker a student a patient or a doctor cannot find that necessary information such as a form to fill out when he or she encounters problems when delivering documents online this portal will help to solve those problems i find it especially important @ today ] when some politicians call * europe ] an imaginary community
we would all like to see jobs back in * europe ]
we had a very good discussion on youth unemployment prior to this discussion i really think that we have an obligation to look into all possibilities for supporting growth and job creation
in this perspective ! one ] perhaps minor but important thing could be employee financial participation efp
efp can strengthen small and medium sized enterprises offering mechanisms for innovative financing as workers may wish to invest in shares in the company by which they are employed
despite these possible benefits the focus on efp varies from member state to member state
this is the reason why i am participating in this very important debate @ today ] because when it comes to employee share ownership and employee financial participation the commission and ` parliament ] as was mentioned by my colleague from the ` epp group ] earlier on have been doing a lot of talking
we have done studies and have collected information data and knowledge
now i think it is time to act
i would like to ask the commissioner a very simple question
are you planning to put forward a proposal for an action plan on this issue
we have adopted an opinion on employee financial participation we have made several studies we have adopted a resolution we have completed a pilot project and so on
i am sure that this was a mistake and i hope you will fix that
in % poland ] the catching up region initiative has helped for example to improve the conditions for starting a business the management of financial instruments or special planning practices
i understand very well that some of you may think that we are demanding too much but on the other hand we all know that challenges in the quality of governance hinder the performance of public investments
i very much welcome the main finding of these reports
instead of reinstating border checks and undermining one of the % eu ] 's fundamental freedoms we need closer coordination among our security and law enforcement agencies instead of gathering ever greater amounts of data and undermining civil liberties we need more effective intelligence sharing to connect the dots from the information we already collect
this is the way in which this ) polish ] authority this ) polish ] government this ) polish ] majority acts
} sophia in t veld ] was totally right when she explained that it is apodictic it is absolute
we are all wrong
we have no idea what is happening there
we get it all wrong and they are all right
the problem in % poland ] is that they are trying to change the state and to model it so that generations to come will have no chance to change it back for the better
that is the thing that we have to be concerned about because there are ! millions and millions ] of ) poles ] probably ! half ] of them more than ! half ] of them that would still make up a pretty big member state who want a future in * europe ]
who want a democratic future
those ) poles ] we are standing up for because they have chosen to be part of the ) european ] society and that is why we care
send their children to a special so called ) european ] school which is completely isolated from the rest of the world
our message is discover your talent
at that time we were focused on the whole business of the modernisation of competition policy the significant amount of work taken forward by former commissioner } mario monti ] and by the current commissioner } neelie kroes ] and on looking at the impact of that in terms of the commission 's ability to deal with the abuse of market power and to deal more effectively with mergers and state aid
we have seen record activity on the part of the commission in terms of dealing with hardcore cartels we have seen the development of the leniency system we have seen record fines put into operation by the commission and we have seen record activity in terms of mergers and state aid notifications as well
however i mention the change of context because of course we all recognise that since the reports were published by the commission the commission 's work in terms of state aid particularly has really taken on a rather different dimension
it is very important and our report says so that in addressing those matters we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective open market
the banking sector in the % united kingdom ] at the moment is ! one ] very clear area where there will have to be when economic circumstances become a little calmer a general review of the new architecture that we have got and of whether that architecture really is compatible with the operation of a free fair and open market
mr president the ` european commission ] produces its annual competition report and it is traditional for the ` european parliament ] to cast its eye over the report and to produce an own initiative reaction to it
that is something similarly that our committee and ` parliament ] have been supportive of
in this case because of timing factors the reports for @ two thousand and six ] and @ two thousand and seven ] have been brought together but taking up ! one ] of the points mentioned by commissioner } barrot ] a little earlier it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather markedly since we in fact began the exercise of considering the report some time ago
our committee has drawn attention to ! two ] specific concerns what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers particularly in relation to food retailing
it is very important that when the commission gives its approval it is giving that approval in ways which are compatible with the treaty and do not create such significant market power in future that it becomes a scenario for abuse in its own right
almost on a daily basis the commission is now looking at the effect of the bail outs that are taking place in the context of the current financial turmoil
by and large that has been a very good story in these reports and this is very clear from the reaction that we have from ` parliament ] 's own report
this is a process that is gathering pace in terms of modernisation because the commission is currently bringing forward proposals in a white paper on introducing private damages
for me as an mep the effects of climate change on the rights of indigenous people are really very close to my heart because the warming climate is the direct or indirect cause of many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of that
our chief incentive during negotiations has to be the implementation of the commitments made by % japan ] to eliminate non tariff barriers in various sectors particularly the automotive sector
now is not the time to say let 's wait a @ few more months ] or we need more concessions now is the time to launch negotiations with % japan ]
we cannot accept that our ! two ] way trade with the world 's ~ third ] largest national economy amounts to only ! a quarter ] of our trade with the % us ] or % china ]
to ensure this i included a provision that if % japan ] has not delivered on its ntb commitments and has not demonstrated sufficient ambition in meeting the % eu ] 's priority demands the commission should stop negotiations after consultations with the ` european parliament ] and the ` council ]
the commission has estimated that nearly ! two thirds ] of such gains under the % eu ] 's trade policy would come from potential agreements with the % us ] and % japan ]
yes @ two days ago ] something happened ! one ] port and $ sanaa airport ] were reopened but it is far from being enough
we have to put productive things on the table
you know that i think you struggle and that you do everything you can but you also have to admit that sometimes some countries are blocking
% poland ] is now going to be president so we need to put maximum pressure on % poland ] to live up to that responsibility
this is why we cannot wait until @ two thousand and twenty ] this is why it is all very well that we will get a legally binding agreement in @ two thousand and fifteen ] but the ` cop ] process needs to create other results long before that
this will only happen if the % eu ] shows direction and to be honest we have not done that for @ a few years ]
can i ask you one question commissioner
why is it that ! one ] country can block progress for the % european union ]
this will only happen if the % eu ] leads
normally we are very polite and do not mention them but @ today ] i would like to mention % poland ] unfortunately because % poland ] has been blocking
i value your work commissioner
it will seriously help us speed up the pace of negotiations and give the global climate agreement a chance
which is very much in line with the commission 's own policy and strategy
madam president the commission has recently provided help to the ) hungarian ] government in order to manage the flows of migrants entering the country
it should at least make sure that the gates are not closed to people who do not have badges
that 's called investment
in % hungary ] i suppose that in the good old days when they were still running newspaper ads in order to sell their passports the money had to be transferred into an offshore account that apparently belonged to the government
there is no passport and no citizenship by investment
there is citizenship by identification integration merit and belief in what we stand for as nations and as the % european union ]
madam commissioner i know that the commission has limited means of action in this regard but please condemn the practice as clearly and as unequivocally as this house does because only then are we going to get the more reluctant member states to realise that what they are doing is wrong
unfortunately even the changes introduced by committee do not go far enough in improving the proposal
i am baffled at the notion of extending the term of copyright whether it is to @ seventy years ] or @ ninety five years ] and i am baffled by it not just because it is dubious and almost out of step with the digital age but also because quite clearly a move like that will primarily
i believe notwithstanding all of the hard work and goodwill that meps should reject this proposal
it is a proposal which i believe will ultimately reward those artists that are already successful and indeed reward the industry
i think the commission needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with the right proposal one that is not just about supporting performers and artists but that in real and practical terms will deliver precisely that
for all ) iraqi ] citizens in general and the ) turkmen ] in particular because they have been numerously targeted on a large scale
this attack claimed the lives of a further ! forty two ] ethnic ) turkmen ] and wounded another
therefore the % eu ] should work closely with the ) iraqi ] government and use all the tools at its disposal to encourage the ) iraqi ] government to provide adequate protection to the ) turkmen ] and other minorities
this resolution is not just for the ) turkmen ] it is for all the minority communities of % iraq ] who long for peace and security
! one hundred and seventeen ] despite the findings of % iraq ] 's own ` high commission for human rights ] which acknowledges that the ) turkmen ] have been subjected to terrorism bombings kidnappings and assassination neither the federal government of % iraq ] nor the ) kurdish ] regional government have done enough to provide security and protection
emission limits for non road mobile machinery might not sound like the sexiest subject but it is an important piece of the jigsaw when it comes to tackling air pollution
the inconvenient truth for those who sought to argue the environmental benefits of a % britain ] outside the % eu ] is that air pollution has an unfortunate habit of not respecting borders
rather than allowing manufacturers to undercut each other in a race to the bottom on environmental standards these ambitious and binding measures on nrmm will ensure industry is manufacturing progressively cleaner engines for these machines which will go a long way to cleaning up toxic air pollution in the % eu ]
over ! one third ] of the % uk ] 's air pollution is blown in from across the * english channel ]
this proposal is a perfect example of how trade in a common market can also deliver environmental and health benefits for citizens
we have always suffered quite a lot of delays in many respects and always we wanted to have our limits lower and higher etc
but now a strict rule a real vision of the future is something we have to tell the people because this is the truth our environment is in heavy danger
congratulations again to the rapporteur
the % eu ] 's cap on bankers bonuses was challenged by the ) british ] government but largely supported by the ) british ] people just as they support action to make ceo pay more accountable
a survey of members of the ` institute of directors ] showed smes felt high pay in some big businesses was harming the reputation of all businesses
so it is great that this directive takes action to improve pay transparency as well as improving many other areas of corporate governance # brexit ] cannot be used as an excuse for progress on this issue to be rolled back particularly in % britain ]
ceos pay has almost doubled over @ the last ten years ] while real pay for the average worker has stagnated dealing with this excessive remuneration is not anti business
the message this directive sends must be heeded across the % eu ] and in % britain ] including after # brexit ]
the effort and costs needed in order to implement & ifrs seventeen ] which are significant unfortunately the signals that we have received from insurance companies that have started to prepare the implementation of the & ifrs seventeen ] confirm the difficulties of this implementation
mr president the single market is ! one ] of the most tangible results of ) european ] integration and yet despite its significant achievements citizens consumers and businesses have become increasingly dissatisfied with it as it often fails to convince them that it truly represents their interests and their aspirations
the main problem is that in the average citizen 's eyes the market is more concerned with vested interests than it is with their needs
we need to start working towards a fairer single market that is politically supported economically viable and socially accepted by ) european ] citizens a market that stimulates sustainable economic growth and job creation but also considers citizens hopes fears and expectations
the comi report is an important step towards achieving a strong green knowledge based social market economy which by turning its focus back to its people will become a common asset of all its citizens reduce unemployment poverty inequalities social exclusion and wage dumping promote respect of fundamental
therefore i urge meps to support the report and in particular the measures aimed at endorsing a highly competitive social market economy providing consumers with the highest level of protection promoting innovative start ups smes and social economy enterprises opposing abuses in the single market which are trying to circumvent existing rules and lower
worker and consumer and environmental standards highlighting the economic social and environmental benefits and challenges of the sharing economy calling for a single ) european ] system for the protection of geographical indications for non agricultural products and supporting the made in labelling which is of crucial importance to protect consumers and provide them with the information they need
we also count on the ` european parliament ] to ensure that the % eu ] voice is more widely heard and we appreciate very much the outreach efforts that you have made in the past
in addition to the shared vision for long term action for mitigation technology and adaptation the identification of appropriate means for financing effective and long term climate policies will be key in future % eu ] deliberations
with the adoption of this package in a few months time the % eu ] will demonstrate that its commitment as well as its leadership in the global fight against climate change is as strong as ever
% pozna ] has also sent the message that the current financial crisis is not to be seen as an obstacle to further action on climate change but instead as yet another opportunity for profoundly transforming our economic system and moving firmly towards a low carbon economy
but of course the % eu ] has repeatedly said that it will not settle for ! twenty ] we want to go for ! thirty ] and therefore we hope for an ambitious global and comprehensive agreement in % copenhagen ]
! one ] of the key elements of any comprehensive global agreement
as you know the work during the presidency will focus on the international negotiation process
its tireless efforts have greatly contributed towards shaping the % eu ] position on climate change
by the way i am leaving % strasbourg ] today and flying to % delhi ] to have discussions with the ) indian ] government and ) indian ] representatives
i have made a preliminary proposal to her for a high level meeting with ) us ] representatives and the ` eu commission ] commissioner } dimas ] the ) czech ] presidency and the upcoming ) swedish ] presidency
the # copenhagen conference ] is now only @ ten months ] away the @ december two thousand and eight ] # pozna climate conference ] agreed on a work programme for @ two thousand and nine ] with clearly identified steps towards # copenhagen ] the decision in % pozna ] on the operationalisation of the adaptation fund represents an important step forward in the negotiations on the financing building block
the ministerial round table in % pozna ] also confirmed the shared willingness of both the developed and the developing countries to find an effective globally agreed response to dangerous climate change for the post @ two thousand and twelve ] period this encompasses further mitigation efforts adaptation actions and finance and technology means to make that response operational
as far as the ets is concerned a single % eu ] cap with a linear downwards trajectory will be set auctioning will be gradually introduced as the method of allocating allowances and monitoring reporting and verification will be strengthened
the ) czech ] presidency intends to build on such important achievements and to pursue efforts at international level towards a successful agreement in % copenhagen ] in @ december two thousand and nine ] on @ two march two thousand and nine ] the ` environment council ] and later the ` ecofin council ] and the ` spring european council ] will be the first opportunities for further developing the % eu ] position in this respect on the basis of the commission communication towards a comprehensive climate change agreement in % copenhagen ] which we received @ a week ago ] and on the basis of your input
~ firstly ] let me congratulate the ` temporary committee on climate change ] for all the work it has accomplished since its creation in @ april two thousand and seven ] hearings conferences reports resolutions exchanges with ~ third ] parties
in this context i can only reiterate the ` climate change committee ] 's call on the commission and the member states to adopt at bilateral level in the negotiations towards a post @ two thousand and twelve ] agreement a mediating role between the positions of developed countries in order to ensure by means of a balance of interest the success of the climate negotiations
this is not my intention @ today ] right at the moment my fears go beyond concerns about basic human rights i fear war and i want to depict a vision
wars in future if this happens human
or others therefore i would like to express my gratitude to the founders and organisers of the prize and salute } andrei sakharov ] whose fight for human rights and freedom became an excellent opportunity to talk about human beings and their basic rights @ two years ago ] upon receiving my sentence a friend asked me if i knew what the exact meaning of the sentence was according to this friend the message carried by the sentence
i knew that i could no longer take my camera into the heart of this society and do the only thing i know how to do film making not making films is a slow death for a film maker always and whenever i decided to prevent
is the narrative of a few making the life of many miserable while using the most unacceptable excuses differences of race sex language religion or political ideas unfortunately the authorities of my country
was for me to run from my country and never come back i still do not know if this interpretation was correct however if it was i never understood why i had to leave my country which i love dearly this love goes way beyond geographical
which speaks of this fear imagine a time when any form of artistic work or practice had vanished and instead all you had is an array of weapons comforting bewildered humans perhaps this
society i live in my creation is the result of a personal perception of fact of life and ontological experiences in my specific society during a lifetime run or live with the sword of } damocles ] above my head that was the question eventually i chose to stay even though
the imprisoned demonstrators } nasrin sotoudeh ] is the outstanding example of such a situation sadly enough we can go on mentioning many cases of extreme injustice in % iran ] and in many other countries around the world however
let me be clear ) european ] integration can indeed transform the politics and economics of candidate countries as it has done in my country but it cannot construct democratic legitimacy of states and their institutions
in this respect i am highly appreciative of commissioner } barnier ] 's strong commitment to take into account citizens concerns and aspirations
in my opinion the single market is not getting the political support urgently needed to ensure that it does not become @ yesterday ] 's business
more political leadership on the single market from the presidents of the commission and ` council ] would go a long way towards achieving a viable single market to serve as a catalyst for economic recovery
we must not lose this political momentum and this unique opportunity to revitalise the single market
i repeat that market integration is not an irreversible process and must not be taken for granted
there are no ~ first ] class and ~ second ] class countries
but % schengen ] will not be completed until all members who want to be part of it have the chance to join
they exist only on maps and in the heads of those who want to destroy the % union ]
! four hundred million ] nationals of more than ! twenty five ] different states travelling free with no passport check with no border controls and within a single country this is what ) europeans ] have accomplished and we have to be very proud of it
in this situation trying to politicise this debate with different issues is a huge mistake ~ first ] because these ! three ] countries are not in the same situation and ~ second ] because accession to * schengen ] cannot be mixed with the cooperation and verification mechanism
the decision on accession to * schengen ] must be based on technical criteria and a delay based on political reasons is simply unacceptable
as was already said it is difficult to imagine the % european union ] today without * schengen ]
this is a very tangible expression of our solidarity and of the freedom and unity of ) european ] citizens and it brings a lot of economic benefits but not for all ) europeans ]
~ first ] it is about credibility if we as a % union ] follow our own rules
~ second ] the economic benefits will bring benefits to all citizens of the % european union ]
instead of wasting money for internal controls we should strengthen through resources and enough financing the external borders of the % union ]
we often complain that anti ) european ] forces populists are using arguments against the % european union ]
this is ! one ] of the cases because it shows injustice to too many ) european ] citizens and now the ` european council ] has to do its job which is not performed an injustice has to be stopped
are you aware that the % united states ] % switzerland ] and % germany ] which are true and historic federations do not have a single national constituency
are you aware that this will reinforce the weight of the big states because it is natural that in the ~ first ] place on each list there will be nationals from the bigger states this will jeopardise the position of % ireland ] and % portugal ]
and this is i guess quite important
madam president i have ! three ] messages ! one ] for all colleagues ! one ] for president } tusk ] and the other for the commission i will be very sharp very loud and very clear
i am very worried about this idea of an extraordinary ` council ] on the composition of the ` european parliament ] this is a competence and a power of our ` parliament ] that then has to be approved by the ` council ] it is true but we have made huge progress i as a professor of constitutional law
the ` council ] should be aware of this in any case
for this reason the % european union ] must pay close attention to the deteriorating human rights situation of the ) iraqi turkmen ] not only because it is our duty but also because this situation is directly associated with stability in the wider * middle east ] region
the ` european parliament ] resolution adopted on @ fourteen march two thousand and thirteen ] was a welcome step forward but was not enough given the current situation @ today ] the cultural religious and economic damage inflicted on the ) turkmen ] population is still highly visible and cannot be ignored by the % european union ] we should not forget all the incidents which took place in the cities of % tuz khurmatu ] and % kirkuk ]
pending conditions
@ over many years ] the agency has demonstrated its capacity to provide education health relief and social services
the other is the european defence fund
the % european union ] is known as a soft power and this identity should be preserved and developed
i would like to stress that the intention to have more than ( eur five billion ] per year for this fund requires own resources for the % european union ]
corruption is not just a private matter that 's why we have to push governments and political and social bodies to fight for themselves against their internal structural corruption
things are not in line with those high standards in some or many of our member states we do not know how many
and it is really very difficult to reach a solution without knowing where this border is and what are the guarantees for the other side of the border the national security area so that we really can say to our citizens yes we have the highest standards
so i urge the commission and ` council ] to provide us with this kind of clear knowledge of what we mean by national security
we should continue to invest our efforts in guaranteeing the implementation of the existing tools and the full use of the % eu ] initiatives dedicated to the fight against cyber threats
we should also continue and intensify work to provide for new and more comprehensive responses to the constantly evolving challenges posed by this threat
the ` council ] remains fully committed to work constructively towards the adoption and effective implementation of concrete measures in that respect
@ today ] the presidency and the ` european parliament ] received key input from the commission on its recommendations for the most challenging issues in the directive regarding its scope and several aspects of implementation that will be instrumental in making the last remaining strides
with this directive the % eu ] is going into unchartered territory in attempting to make our new digital lives more safe and secure
this is admittedly not an easy process as developing legislation on a highly technical issue that touches at the same time on national security is no easy task the ) latvian ] presidency continues and will continue to work to make significant progress on this issue by the @ end of june ]
we shall also continue our efforts towards introducing effective and creative practical preventive and control measures that will go beyond the necessary legislative minimum
dramatic changes in the media landscape in particular the introduction of new technologies have resulted in an unprecedented flow of information
despite draconian measures neither totalitarian regimes nor terrorists are able to firmly close the tap and fully prevent the information flow
the media serve as a catalyst for a rapid and effective global response and thus they are vital to the survival of a democratic society
mr president i would to like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs because this negotiation procedure has not been the traditional i want this you want that let 's meet in the middle
this report will feature a financial instrument that will make it profitable for shipowners to scrap their ships legally
there has been a massive lobbying campaign against this proposal by the ports but it is actually based on incorrect information
the money collected will go back to the sector if they follow the law
they have been warning against huge administrative burdens while the impact assessment said that this is a very efficient administrative way to deal with this problem
! three ] ! two ] so please support these financial instruments & amendments thirty one and thirty two ] so that we can negotiate with the council which stands ready to negotiate with us
this will require proactive interventions by member state governments
free market theology must not stand in the way of doing right by workers
so is the common refrain that we must learn the lessons of this economic crisis genuine
if it is then the case for fundamental change in % eu ] policy and indeed % eu ] treaties is now unanswerable and should be the stuff of ` eu council ] deliberations
we need a new treaty for a new time
so i call upon the ` council ] to act according to legislation according to democracy
mr president new technologies are rapidly changing the nature of the financial infrastructure around the globe
this presents massive opportunities for * europe ] and it is now up to us the policymakers to make the right choices and create a conducive environment so that * europe ] can benefit to the full extent
fintech is often used to refer to a specific scenario of startups disrupting finance with innovation
this definition is not the one used in our report because it would exclude a large number of relevant actors
instead fintech may be understood as finance enabled by new technologies covering the whole range of financial services products and infrastructure
it also includes insuretech the use of new technologies in insurance and regtech the application of new technologies for regulatory compliance the current rise of fintech comes after the origination of a number of different technological developments within a short time span
namely artificial intelligence cloud computing and distributed ledger technology
these provide new opportunities for disruptions like mobile payments open banking crowdfunding crypto currencies and robo advice
fintech can lead to significant benefits such as cost reductions efficiency gains and more transparency
it can also be an effective tool for financial inclusion opening up highlevel services for those who could not afford them before
furthermore fintech can enable crossborder financial flows and infrastructure through alternative lending and investment channels
the fintech revolution that we are currently experiencing is global
the bulk of these investments was made in the % united states ] and * asia ] and % israel ] are also gearing up in this respect
the % us ] % china ] and % israel ] host ! more than half ] of the top ! ten ] largest fintech companies
if * europe ] wants to remain competitive rapid innovation should be the norm not the exception
this is not only important for * europe ] 's financial infrastructure but also for the real economy with consumers and businesses benefiting from improved financial services
notwithstanding all the benefits fintech also confronts us with essential questions of a regulatory societal nature
consumer protection and the stability of the financial system should be key concerns in this regard
together with the competitiveness of the ) european ] economy they make for the core priorities of this report
the report does not intend to give technical solutions
however it does intend to pose the right questions
that should be a first step in the process of creating a forwardlooking ) european ] policy in the area of financial technologies
the intention of this report is not to propose specific legislative actions
we must be cautious with creating new rules because much is still unclear about future developments of financial technologies
a better point of departure is investigating where current legislation causes uncertainties or barriers and identifying where additional action is necessary
doing this purposefully requires a holistic approach as technological developments in our digitising society call for breaking silos
fintech actors are already breaking silos themselves
they often offer products in a diverse multi party conjunction
i have some minutes left at the end and will use the time then
in order to go on with any kind of digital services we have to have very strong common simple and understandable data protection regulations
i very much hope that in cooperation with the commission and ` parliament ] we can make it clear to the ` council ] that the package of data protection is crucial for the development of the digital single market
the ) roma ] people have been suffering all through ) european ] history but the situation has never been better
@ today ] we have an opportunity to give prosperity to all of the people of * europe ]
please address that in your reply and do not continue to attack the people that are moving across borders
in addition with the implementation of a harmonised ) european ] approach making these websites accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business
the directive now covers all % eu ] public sector bodies websites and websites providing public services as now laid down in a new annex
this directive is essentially a forerunner in the planned & european accessibility act ] which i know is also being eagerly awaited by our citizens
the specifications for accessibility are technology neutral and based on the international web content accessibility guidelines
in our increasingly digital world accessibility is very much a human right all people are entitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights
less than ! one third ] of * europe ] 's public sector and government websites and even less than ! ten ] of * europe ] 's websites in general are fully accessible
however despite the fact that assistive technology already exists * europe ] has been lagging far behind
in * europe ] this amounts to ! eighty million ] citizens with disabilities and another ! eighty seven million ] aged over @ sixty five ] ! one hundred and sixty seven million ] ) european ] citizens is too great a number to be ignored throughout my involvement with this dossier i have seen what these people face when trying to navigate their way online i was particularly struck by the difficulties faced by the blind which was exemplified at an ` imco ] committee hearing held in @ april ]
we are the % european union ] we should be setting the agenda not struggling or even failing to keep up
making websites and their content useable for all should already have become a priority at % eu ] level
this piece of legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited both by citizens with disabilities and by our increasingly ageing population who find themselves more and more isolated and excluded from a world where information is accessible primarily online
the ` imco committee ] was more ambitious and made a number of significant amendments to the text
i am sure the ) greek ] presidency will follow up the good work on this file and it is completely feasible that the ) italian ] presidency will be able to bring this dossier into legislation
the scope along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems reflects the binding obligations set out in the # un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities ] and the commitments made in the digital agenda for * europe ]
the financial benefits are currently estimated at ( eur two billion ]
however i thank commissioner } kroes ] for having openly supported our legislative work using one of the most modern ways of rapid communication [ twitter ]
however this is only the ~ first ] step in the legislative process we regret the lack of engagement by previous presidencies on this dossier
this is both an ethical issue and a commercial issue
it is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs
in the speech you said that after a @ year ] of work in another country the country in which the frontier worker had worked should be financially responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits
the guiding principle behind this is that a frontier worker should receive benefits from the country in which he or she has contributed
this is fair for everybody you said
i completely agree with this principle therefore commissioner i would like to ask you @ tonight ] if you think that this principle that a person should receive benefits from the country in which he or she has contributed should apply not only to frontier workers but to all mobile workers within the % eu ]
you mentioned that there are differences between the countries in youth unemployment you mentioned % spain ] and % greece ] for example
the aim is to undermine the work of legislators such as us and at the same time mislead consumers
this is leaving ! millions ] of fraudulent cars on our roads more than @ two years ] after the # dieselgate scandal ] and our committee work in this ` parliament ]
in our economy commissioner and in our society no private company no sector they may be the largest they may have a lot of people working there but none of them should be allowed to act as they do today as the car industry does today because then they think they are
suppose we were to follow your order and receive migrants and refugees in my country % hungary ] you as well as every single person in this room know perfectly well that those people would not want to stay in % hungary ] because they want a better life
what is the order so to say in this respect
we all know very well that we cannot put these people into a closed institution
they have the right to freedom of movement
i know we should integrate them
this will probably be the answer but this is the wrong answer mr } timmermans ] and dear colleagues because they would not like to be integrated in % hungary ] they would like to move on the next day to richer countries so you must have a strategy on that because your whole strategy about the treatment of the migrant crisis
we are in a position to pressure the ) cuban ] government more to open up
implementation and enforcement are fundamental for our future
a good application of % eu ] law is basic in order to regain the support of our citizens and increase the efficiency of our monetary union
we need to ensure this before talking about more integration
the @ two thousand and eleven ] enlargement report on % iceland ] clearly demonstrates % iceland ] 's advanced level of preparation the closure of ! eight ] negotiation chapters is most welcome but the challenging negotiations are yet to come and i mean here chapters such as fisheries and agriculture which will need special attention given that circumstances in % iceland ] are different from those of other ) european ] countries
greater importance should also be given to negotiations on chapters such as regional policy the environment and economic and monetary policy i saw that according to the recent poll the majority of ) icelanders ] still oppose % eu ] membership since ! sixty seven ] are against and only ! thirty three ] in favour of accession but my remark is that in the @ last year ] support for the % eu ] in both candidate and member states has been very low and therefore % iceland ] should continue to remain committed to the conclusion of the accession talks
the legislator defined both mandatory information and voluntary information for consumers making information a crucial point of the legislation
it is critical that consumers have access to complete information in order to make an informed choice
the resolution of the ` committee on fisheries ] discusses the commission survey for control of @ two thousand and fifteen ] which analyses the conformity of labelling with the legal requirements of white fish in retail
however numbers are worrying for some species for which the level of conformity is very low common species are substituted for more expensive species
it could help in the creation of an external structure which scrutinises the certification of voluntary claims included on the label of fishery and aquaculture products
i would also like to remind the commission that ` parliament ] is still awaiting the commission report on the possibility to define and establish minimum criteria for the creation of an % eu ] ecolabel for fishery and aquaculture products
further information on fish can be added to a label as an addition to compulsory information
member states must implement sanctions which are efficient proportionate and dissuasive
compulsory and correct information must be available for consumers all the way through the chain including diners in restaurants
it deals with voluntary information on fishery products and aims at creating an uptodate and exhaustive inventory of voluntary claims associated with fishery and aquaculture products which are marketed in the % european union ] whatever their origin
the commission is currently working on the implementation of a pilot project proposed by ` parliament ] @ last year ] and my regards to our chair mr } cadec ] who could not be here @ today ]
this inventory will enable an analysis of the certification systems of these claims
it is also necessary that such information be reliable meaning it must be controlled in a very strict manner
this information can enable consumers to have complementary information such as the date of catch date of landing more information on fishing gear the flag state information on the nutritional value of the product or environmental ethical or social information
in a separate study from @ last year ] on labelling in restaurants in % brussels ] including the * eu ] canteens the ngo ` oceana ] estimates mislabelling at ! thirty two ] overall with a mislabelling rate in bluefin tuna to be ! eighty ] this observation brings us to ask member states to enforce the existing law
~ first ] and foremost member states have to reinforce controls in order to identify fraud and the missing links in the supply chain for fishery and aquaculture products which lead to mislabelling or fraud
it is the duty of member states to guarantee that this information is available and accurate
we are awaiting this external structure and hope that this information will be easily accessible to consumers
the publication of this report is a requirement of the common market organisation for fishery and aquaculture regulation
this is often the case for bluefin tuna
compulsory information is the following the commercial designation of a species and its scientific name the production method and fishing gear the area where the product was caught or produced and a clear indication whether the product was defrosted this mandatory information applies to both retail and supply for caterers and restaurants
restaurants must always keep the information which they received when they bought the product in case consumers or state authorities ask for them
we need to promote public awareness and online safety especially among children but also among parents so that they know exactly what is going on and what can be done on the internet
a wonderful source of information for all of us and something that will be part of our lives into the future however there are those who prey on children and they will use the internet as much as they possibly can to try to undermine children
i think member states should work together to introduce a network of contact points for the public to reach in order to report illegal and harmful content and conduct
if i could turn to activity based budgeting and management i think the commission has made huge progress on this but i would warn against over bureaucratising this exercise because what we want to ensure is a qualitative evaluation not simply ticking boxes
this would allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the commission 's annual work programmes
mr president out of this budget review we simply have to ask ourselves ! one ] question does the budget reflect the political priorities of the @ twenty first century ] if it does not it needs changing
is it flexible enough to reflect changing times
we do not want people spending all their time evaluating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work
too much is left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the & mff ]
now it is about a university it is about ngos it is above all about the next national consultation
we have witnessed an attempt or rather a vague idea to reintroduce the death penalty and all that coming from a man who is constantly referring to ) christian ] values
now the only thing that comes to my mind in this context is if all foreign influence is so bad why do you accept the payment of ( eur five billion euros ] annually as a big net recipient of ) european ] structural funds in order to plaster the whole country with the posters in which you called % brussels ] crap
somebody who does that prime minister leaves the union out of their own accord
we have witnessed several unspeakably worded national consultations in the meantime
the ngo thing prime minister is not about transparency as we all know it is in order to label ngos that are foreign funded as foreign because they might carry foreign influence in % hungary ] and foreign influence is bad
it escapes me prime minister where the death penalty would be on any ) christian ] agenda and i have rarely found any ) christian ] theologian who would have been able to find anything good about the death penalty
when was the last time ! one million ] people marched through the streets of a ) european ] capital demanding more % eu ] integration
it is also a moment of truth for our policy in the eastern neighbourhood and i would dare to say the biggest test yet of the % eu ] 's performance as a geopolitical player capable of defending its interests and values in the immediate neighbourhood
@ may ] i fully share the parliament 's sense of urgency to make progress on this proposal
i therefore welcome the proposal of the ` committee on budgets ] of the ` european parliament ] which proposes to restore most of the appropriations proposed by the commission in the draft budget
@ two thousand and fifteen ] we cannot afford to have the % eu ] budget paralysed we need to bring it under control and we have at this moment a unique opportunity to do so
i fully agree that we must act responsibly and address at this stage the needs that we have in payments
however even if further reinforcement contributes to increasing investments we should try and find the right balance with the implementation prospects and the payments availability
we should seize such an opportunity to address the shortage of payment appropriations
all this has to be achieved within very tight financial circumstances and very tight budgetary ceilings
we must also honour our obligations and pay outstanding bills stemming from past commitments thus avoiding an unnecessary burden on beneficiaries
sustainable economic growth competitiveness the creation of jobs and the fight against youth unemployment are other urgent priorities of the % eu ] policy and should be reflected in the orientation of % eu ] expenditure for @ two thousand and fifteen ] we must do this under a clear and agreed framework and provide the necessary predictability and security for our investments and our partners
we must put all our efforts into making this framework fully operational fully respecting all the terms of this agreement
@ two thousand and fifteen ] @ last month ] i expressed before this house the commission 's concern about the position taken by the ` council ] in its reading of the @ two thousand and fifteen ] budget
exceptional additional revenue from fines stemming from the enforcement of competition policy means that the additional payment requests for @ two thousand and fourteen ] will be in total at no cost for member states
the level of payment appropriations remains the paramount concern that we need to address at this budget conciliation we must ensure that the legal obligations arising in @ two thousand and fifteen ] are met and put a stop to the snowball effect of shifting an ever increasing amount of unpaid bills into future years
too we must avoid artificial under budgeting in future as we are now all aware of the problems that such an approach brings
the reinforcement of payment appropriations proposed by the commissions & amending letter no one ] go in the same direction as a number of amendments proposed by ` parliament ] where the needs are most pressing and in particular with the aim of reducing the backlog of unpaid bills and allowing the proper launching of the new programmes
in its draft budget the commission has proposed using the full amount of payment appropriations under the mff ceiling for
as you know favourable developments on the revenue side in @ two thousand and fourteen ] provide an opportunity to find agreement in this direction
i have in mind for example the ` eu covenant of mayors ] which has been contributing to our climate and energy objectives since
this is indeed where regions and cities should be when it comes to finding solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation they have proved to be ambitious forward looking and innovative so we need all of them on board
there will be no place for business as usual
i think it is very important
mr president adoption is a wonderful alternative for otherwise unwanted children or a child that 's left in an unsafe environment
but what concerns me about this report is that it 's another power grab by % brussels ] over the jurisdiction of family law
in the % uk ] there are strict laws about family courts including the privacy of proceedings for what is and always will be a very emotive subject
but what i fear with this latest demand for more * europe ] is that the best interests of the child may be put second to the % eu ] 's desire for more and more power
and what happens if it is a disputed adoption
if the grandparents want to adopt
or ! one ] parent is actually fighting the case
how will that work if the child is taken across another country 's border into another culture or maybe where the child will be brought up speaking a different language
i believe that we all should be encouraging families to be strong and cohesive units which is the best environment for bringing up a child surely
we seriously disagree with that just witness the political meddling in the # brexit ] process or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider and this is not an issue for ` nato ] 's eastern flank this is a larger concern to that we need to deal with the ~ second ] and probably much more important point
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly the security defence and political challenge that % russia ] poses for the % european union ]
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this file as it stands now
this is an obligation for a bilateral individual response between member states
thank you very much
i don 't think i need to remind my honourable colleagues that this particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response
but they will do so only when ) ukrainians ] manage to fulfil all the agreed and outstanding conditions
i believe that our common goal is to help % ukraine ] but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation
a step in the right direction is the adoption of the law on the high anti corruption court this @ last week ]
@ two thousand and fourteen ] this time the commission proposes ( eur one billion ] to be dispersed as medium and long term loans
~ third ] the reform process which has been important but is not really steady until now
therefore it is crucial that the ! two ] unfulfilled anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions
this memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the disbursements of the funds
that being said to address any doubts that may arise during this debate the mfa is not an unconditional support
~ first ] the worsening conflict and casualties in the east of % ukraine ] and all the many socio economic consequences of this aggression
~ second ] the economic recovery which remains fragile
if corruption is not addressed drastically mfa funds should not be delivered to % ukraine ]
in that context i would like to highlight ! three ] key elements
there are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve economic stabilisation and support the reforms it is very important to remind that the commission cancelled the last tranche of the ~ third ] mfa programme when some of % ukraine ] 's commitments were not fulfilled
in addition the newly adopted law was signed @ yesterday ] by the president of % ukraine ] the rapporteur welcomes this news with great satisfaction it means that ) ukrainians ] take the commitment seriously
the assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in % ukraine ] which is done by agreeing with the ) ukrainian ] authorities a memorandum of understanding
hence the need for support for these reforms in the context where many interests can play against especially in pre election years
in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation this is the ~ fourth ] time that the commission proposes macrofinancial assistance for % ukraine ] since the beginning of the war in
if we are serious about our goal we cannot slow down the procedures
i am very grateful that we are where we are now indeed % ukraine ] needs this support and it deserves this support and it is very appropriate to have this next programme now
i am grateful to the commissioner that you although it is not included in the joint declaration explicitly referred to that because that is what it is also about
we need to be very clear in this regard
however the eternally crucial issue remains that of the implementation
mr president you can 't save your money and spend it you can 't have you cake and eat it and you can 't pretend to be a nation when you are not
the % european union ] despite what it likes to think is not a nation
it follows that it cannot be and should not be a party to such international agreements this one and many others
happily we have the perfect opportunity to play it and play it repeatedly
we the % united kingdom ] are permanent members of the ` united nations security council ] we must not give this up on the contrary we must start to make better use of it
this means using it to oppose block and even veto behaviour on international treaties conventions and agreements which are against our interest there is a clear ) uk ] message here for the % european union ] do you think you hold all the cards
you don 't
our hand is potentially a lot better than you understand
what the % uk ] has to do however is to understand itself how good our hand is and then be prepared to use it
if the ) british ] government is worth anything at all those who play hardball with us should and i hope will find that we can play hardball with them
it could form the blueprint for radical change without decreasing the funding going to newer member states i have called on the ) uk ] government to include these open europe proposals in its reform and renegotiation discussions after all we are talking about a ! third ] of the % eu ] 's total budget
that is quite difficult to explain briefly but it is about not shuffling money around from one country to another and not particularly that large scale recipient countries give money to the commission that the commission then gives them back and tells them what to do
rather it is focusing on countries like yours in situations like yours so that cohesion achieves sustainable economic growth and lifts people out of that situation for the benefit of everybody within the % eu ] on a limited basis not forever
it will be an unnecessary collection of much information about travellers who are completely innocent
they have to delete the data after the exit unless there is a risk or a suspicion what we expect from the ) canadian ] authorities with regard to our citizens we should also respect with regard to citizens of thirdcountries like % canada ]
we are not fixing the system which is not working because some of the member states authorities are not thoroughly working with the system and feeding information into it
we have to check their passports and that is exactly what we are doing
but with this system you do not keep track of any visa over stayer in the % european union ]
stop bashing % hungary ] stop preaching to us about solidarity and talk about solidarity to those strong healthy young ) syrian ] and other men who should go home and rebuild their countries
but at the same time you know that people are tired of words and promises and it is time for action from the commission as well the strongest tool which you possess as a commission is the draft of your budget for the next multiannual financial framework we should stop thinking about how to reduce the ) european ] budget
but look for own resources
we should really focus on political priorities and the major priority is how to move from a * europe ] of divergence and inequalities towards a * europe ] of convergence strong economic growth and social justice
this means that life for people in * europe ] is better and that is what people expect from
i agree and i appreciate
in some cases a certificate of legality will only be a starting point the ~ first ] measure included in the due diligence procedure
~ firstly ] i would like to refer to the due diligence approach which is more comprehensive than just a certificate of legality
where the risk assessment has shown that the country of origin presents a higher risk of administrative corruption or in countries where enforcement of national laws is weak additional guarantees are necessary to underpin the certified legality
the principle of due diligence reflects the legal obligation of a proactive behaviour to a certain legality and needs to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be reasonably assured
we should keep in mind that patterns of tropical deforestation are the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which vary in importance in different locations
in the % european union ] we understand that working on the coherence of our policies must go hand in hand with supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen national and local institutions and make progress towards effective governance and use of forest resources i wish to thank again
i am encouraged that ` parliament ] while endorsing the approach of the commission wants to reinforce it further and has made amendments to this end
i also want to assure you that the commission will give careful consideration to the amendments of the proposed regulation
this is what they need
moreover we will investigate any barriers that may prevent consumers from switching to better offers
we also think that a single market for retail financial services which can rely on innovative solutions is very welcome
a high level of environmental protection is of course of the highest priority for the commission
the developing countries have delivered we asked them for a road map for a legally binding global agreement
i think that when it comes to such sensitive topics we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as % eu ] internal and % eu ] external issues because terrorist actions might be planned outside the % eu ] but can seriously affect the people living inside the % eu ]
they are in your portfolio no poverty reducing inequality decent work
let me conclude
it is a sine qua non for the future of our planet and for the future of our people
you could say that in times of fake news it is good to have data
therefore reaching the sustainable development goals within the % eu ] is vital
it says that we are making progress and we are moving in the right direction
mr president the ` international energy agency ] just recently published a report saying that the developed countries of this world the industrialised countries have @ about five years ] to change fundamentally the way they produce energy and the way they consume energy
in order for us to stay below a < two degree ] increase in temperature
now if we do not stay below < two degrees ] we know what will happen
then if we look at what has actually now been pledged by the same countries the countries that need to change fundamentally within @ five years ] it is unfortunately very unsatisfactory
we see a situation now where the pledges are about ! half ] of what we need in order to reach our target
we all know that we will not get a full legally binding agreement with regard to mitigation in % durban ] that will solve these problems but we know also that we have possibilities to pursue targets that are ambitious nonetheless targets that will get us closer to our final goal
this is why we have a moral obligation to help them financially
the fact that it is colder here now is also quite predictable because if the gulf stream is pressed down by meltwater from the * arctic ] this is an explainable effect
it has to do with a very important argument on democracy
cabotage caused problems inside member states in national transport
now we are limiting it to @ two days ] per member state and it will be posting from @ day one ] nomadic driving drivers have a new right to go back home by the end of a maximum of @ three weeks ]
we are ending driver misuse and letter box companies
for the ~ first ] time common strong enforcement is possible by using the latest technology available if the national transport is posting from day ! one ] colleagues voting against can go back home and tell drivers that in the future they might not drive for their national salaries anymore instead they could be
paid a final country destination minimum wage
this is a ! twoway ] street
you need to understand what it means for the universally applicable collective agreements if you oppose the mandate
minimum wages might become the new norm and you should all be aware of that
currently we do not have a common % eu ] minimum wage level in transport and the posting of the drivers directive is not the right tool to do that
that is totally another discussion
we need a rich content of information and to facilitate access to information which could improve our lives and lead to concrete economic growth
~ first ] we should have a better guarantee and a better look at the additionality
there we have to support these countries so they have a better capacity to take it up quality to make projects and investment banks as my colleague has said
it has to do with a very important argument on democracy
} oleg sentsov ] 's case is no longer just a judicial or political one
he should be immediately and unconditionally released on humanitarian grounds
it is now a matter of human compassion
cabotage caused problems inside member states in national transport
now we are limiting it to @ two days ] per member state and it will be posting from day one
nomadic driving drivers have a new right to go back home by the end of a maximum of @ three weeks ]
we are ending driver misuse and letter box companies
for the ~ first ] time common strong enforcement is possible by using the latest technology available
if the national transport is posting from day ! one ] colleagues voting against can go back home and tell drivers that in the future they might not drive for their national salaries anymore instead they could be paid a final country destination minimum wage
this is a ! twoway ] street
you need to understand what it means for the universally applicable collective agreements if you oppose the mandate
minimum wages might become the new norm and you should all be aware of that
currently we do not have a common % eu ] minimum wage level in transport and the posting of the drivers directive is not the right tool to do that
} daphne galizia ] was known internationally was known globally for her fight against corruption she reported on the corruption
% malta ] is geographically and historically ! one ] of the gates and ! one ] of the doors of the % european union ]
she reported on the # panama papers ] and we have seen we have read we have heard and we could not ignore that the # panama papers ] are directly implicated with some ) maltese ] authorities
it should be the bastion of the protection of human rights the rule of law the independence of judicial power and impartially of criminal prosecution
the commission and the ) maltese ] authorities to do is to grant respect and observation of the rule of law
but a similar concern and wish for dialogue in relation to % spain ] is not shown by the % european union ] institutions in spite of having there more than strong signals of breaches of the rule of law of democracy and of fundamental rights
point ~ five ] expresses concerns about the rule of law democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media independence of the police and judiciary
! half ] of this government is in prison the other ! half ] in exile
i am ashamed and we all should be ashamed because without this killing we would never have known here what happens in % malta ] journalists being harassed denounced and even killed media houses being blackmailed by banks suspected of money laundering and tax evasion
high government officials suspected of being implicated also in the same operations and police authorities refusing to investigate those allegations because they have been appointed by and have economic and personal ties with the government
we cannot remain silent so @ today ] we ask for ! three ] concrete actions ~ first ] we want the commission to immediately launch a rule of law dialogue with % malta ]
~ second ] we want the ) maltese ] authorities to investigate and to prosecute money laundering no matter the names or the organisations implicated
~ thirdly ] we want an independent and international investigation into the killing of } daphne caruana galizia ] we have to say loud and clear that * europe ] 's values and principles are much more important than money
* europe ] is about justice about separation of powers and about the rule of law
everybody knows that
but * europe ] is also about freedom transparency and truth
the legislation to implement pnr has been submitted to our ` parliament ] and is being discussed in our house
states taxation is a key element of the political systems in our democracies and in the treaty they are therefore part and i believe rightly so of the member states competencies
i was very happy that you made this point and we have to work on that
fully agree i did not mention it in my speech but the same pay for the same work in the same type of circumstances is at the core of the belief of the ) dutch ] government and we will push
there can be no doubt and i am happy that i know that the whole commission is behind it
will rise maybe not for you personally but this is happening at
reform yes we are working on new alliances within
free market thanks to the free market ! hundreds of millions ] of people in @ the last ten to fifteen years ] have been lifted out of poverty
we are we are pushing for radical
for our defence it is crucial to keep the dialogue with the % united states ] going even if within that family relationship we have some serious quarrels at the moment
help we have to do this collectively
they agree in many cases as we all know they very much disagree and that also helps the debate in those
it to me you have this big
) dutch ] union and i am absolutely convinced that in @ those days ] she would have fully agreed with what i have just
~ secondly ] on migration here @ today ] i reach out my hand to % italy ] because i know that they have to deal with an extremely difficult situation
thank you all for participating in this debate
i am absolutely convinced that we cannot just say there are new tasks which have to be funded and at the same time we cannot find savings in the existing budget that is the plea i am making here that is exactly what all the member states have to do i believe that simply saying we have to go
there were so many questions i cannot answer all of them but i have tried to bring them back to basically ! four ] key issues
this is also my answer to mr } bashir ] on this issue better guarding of our borders and working on better return mechanisms for rejected asylum seekers
but i also eagerly await the ) italian ] government 's national measures because they have to do a lot in order to manage the inflow of illegal migrants better and then they know that we stand ready to show solidarity and as the % european union ] to work collectively to address this issue which no doubt will be with us for @ years ] to come
* europe ] i believe that social affairs have to stay at a national level but when social affairs have a cross border impact then * europe ] also needs to get involved
level we also have to remain focused and this is crucial on structural
it 's about time that the ` council ] fingers point not at those who act like the new government in % spain ] but at those who do not act
~ number two ] the question cannot be externalised and the answer cannot be simply repressive
it has to be holistic and preventive
but then you have to explain to us how this is compatible this giant external % european union ] with an internal dwarf % european union ]
this is not sustainable
and let me put a final question do you really believe that { one per cent ] of the budget { one per cent ] of gdp is the fast track the big way for the big government of the ) european ] institutions
please be reasonable
about ! eighty ] of all new jobs in the % european union ] have been created by smes and in my own constituency of % dublin ] about ! four hundred zero ] people are employed by about ! one hundred zero ] companies in the sme sector
the challenge that we have at the moment is about jobs jobs jobs and we must bend over backwards to try and protect existing employment and hopefully in @ the years ahead ] try and create new jobs
that is absolutely essential for all of us
if we want to get our small businesses and employment to stabilise in the % european union ] and in each individual member state we must do everything we possibly can to try and save them
we must do all we possibly can at the moment to support these companies in difficult times
the sectors most affected are mining extractive industries agribusiness hydroelectric dams and water rights and logging
@ two thousand and fifteen ] in @ two thousand and sixteen ] there were around ! four ] murders per week and this murderous trend went on @ this year ]
the % eu ] and its member states are clearly not doing enough to ensure corporate accountability and legal redress
this annual report includes strong language on the shrinking space for civil society including the call for an % eu ] monitoring mechanism for cases of violations of freedom of assembly and association
environmental human rights defenders like her are under threat when they oppose the interests of corporations and governments
% hungary ] where one can witness cronyism at its finest is a perfect example to demonstrate this problem
~ first ] introduction of targeted measures against individuals responsible for grave human rights violations and ~ second ] providing active support for civil society groups and defenders of human rights i would like here to extend our sympathy and support for the ) iranian ] people who have since the @ end of last year ]
this is coming back to us after successful conclusion of the negotiations and i would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and also the commission for its assistance in facilitating this deal which actually places demands on facilities so that the practice known as beaching is not possible any more and that is a great step forward
when you look at the situation in % greece ] it is difficult
of course a lot of the things in that agreement between the % union ] and the member states and % turkey ] have to be dealt with and elaborated on and those individual aspects will of course when it is legally bound to be dealt with by the proper institutions
the border will not be opening again
we need to work at full speed on a ) european ] border guard system on a revision of % dublin ] and on more structural ) european ] solutions
it is not the solution it is an outline of possible solutions and it is the beginning of the implementation and hard work that has been done and has to be done
you cannot survive being at sea so you have to engage with the country on the other side and you have to engage with countries on the other side of the external borders so agreement with % turkey ] would have been necessary in any case
there are a lot of things to be built up from scratch
so we are seeing improvements we are seeing positive effects already but we also realise that a lot has to be done
the ) greek ] government is also doing what it can to help and member states are supporting it
part of the way it dealt with it before was by ngos supplying the food
but ! one ] thing has to be clear their only solution is to apply for asylum in % greece ] get into that system and offer themselves up for relocation
but in our position it is not an agreement within the legal meaning of & article two hundred and eighteen ] of the treaty
it offers us new challenges that are more manageable than the old ones that we had to face @ last year ] but they are still challenges and they still lead to a lot of work and a lot of improvement that we are doing on a dayby day week by week basis
it is quite clear that they have a right to be heard they have a right to a procedure and they have a right to an appeal they are processed regularly
that has happened and a lot of work has to be done in practice to improve the plight of the people in the reception facilities and also to get this new system of readmission started
we are also combining this with getting more of a grip on who is coming to the ) european ] member states for protection and who is being offered protection in the region and in % turkey ]
be very aware that there is a risk of other routes and that we have to work hard to find solutions to prevent those routes from leading to a large influx posing member states with a lot of issues and to put it most horribly having the refugees and the migrants whether regular or not putting their lives at great risk
we also commend the hard work being done on the ) turkish ] side to improve the situation of the refugees they harbour they harbour ! millions ] there so it is a lot of work and also the legal safeguards and the legal position of those people has been improved by % turkey ] which helps us enormously in making this agreement work and having a better solution than we had before
so we are seeing improvements every day but we fully realise as member states and as the ` council ] that we are not there yet and a lot has to be done
i think that is the biggest benefit we can already see from this agreement
of course other member states have to do a lot as well
let me say from the council perspective and the member states perspective that this is not a perfect solution but it is the best solution that we can find right now
unfortunately for the time being it seems to me that we are not on the way to reducing this uncertainty
# brexit ] is an unfortunate reality but we have to move on
we i think i should rephrase that most of us believe in a future * europe ] that upholds the fundamental value of solidarity on issues like migration and in a * europe ] that strives to guarantee the safety and security of its citizens
we must use as a basic platform the established principles respect for human rights and dignity freedom equality and rule of law
any progress registered on the future of * europe ] must be followed up and translated into action
having spent almost @ nine years ] myself in this institution i know how crucial and meaningful ` parliament ] 's continuous role and participation is in this defining moment for the future shaping of the ) european ] project colleagues we need to draw on this momentum and galvanise and energise our forces to forge a stronger better % union ]
we believe that success belongs to those who can harness positive forces that unite rather than divide
current indicators show that we have once again started to register successes we believe that the % union ] should be should be robustly positioned to shape and manage better globalisation not merely react to it
this could pave the way for the eventual erosion of unity
a strong * europe ] is needed to bring about the right balance in a world order which is shifting
some options to me seem to be more attractive than others and who knows there may be other options which have not yet been brought to the table
we must face up to the reality that ) europeans ] horizons have shifted
having said that reform does not mean a whole redesign of * europe ]
we have a fragile balancing act to perform a balance between flexibility which is not so loose as to threaten the meaning of a real % union ] and intransigent rigidity which would undermine the whole process of the ) european ] project
we believe in creating better conditions for growth jobs and higher living standards through the % union ] 's single market
these are the values that reflect the soul of the % union ] and form the core of any future * europe ]
yes we are living in times of extraordinary unpredictability and it would be a big mistake to underestimate the major setbacks and challenges but it would be an even bigger mistake to fall into a negative mind set and resign ourselves to doing nothing
the % european union ] is not about % brussels ] it is not about % strasbourg ] nor is it about the institutions to which many of us involved in @ today ] 's debate belong
never has there been a more important time for member states and the institutions to remain united never has there been such a crucial time for all of us to focus on the big picture and shut out potentially distracting unnecessarily divisive issues
it has nothing in common with the democracies of * europe ] and therefore % turkey ] should never ever be allowed to join the % european union ]
but they were men and women of their time as it is a treaty of its time
because what began as a noble economic plan has morphed into a political monster egged on by successive eurocrats who are hungry for ever more power and determined to destroy the nation state
what continues to amaze me is that you never learn
you talk about an existential crisis but you say what is needed is even more % eu ] you are fiddling whilst the & treaty of rome ] burns so what i will say is simply this i urge caution when you are celebrating @ next week ] because # brexit ] could trigger a floodgate whereby other countries leave that same treaty you are celebrating @ next week ]
to } dawit isaak ] and his family i just want to say that you have many friends in this ` parliament ] and we will not stay silent until the day } dawit isaak ] is back home in % sweden ] in safety
dreaming and peacefully acting for democracy must never be a crime
for @ nineteen years ] his wife and his children have tried to do everything they can to get him released
there is something rotten in the world when people can be jailed and in the worst cases be deprived of their lives just because they dream of a better society a better world
mr president ~ first ] and foremost i want to thank all my colleagues for the good cooperation that has made this resolution possible an urgency that talks about real people 's lives because oppression and injustice are not only words
} martin luther king ] wisely once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
furthermore the ` council ] 's ` legal service ] has been requested to provide an opinion and the presidency is now waiting for this opinion before continuing the discussions
madam president i would like to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to deliver on behalf of the commission a statement on the nord stream two project i know that this continues to be a subject to which many of you attach a high importance and which we have discussed already
! three ] different approaches to the mandate can be distinguished at this stage in the ` council ]
a number of times
~ first ] there is a significant number of member states which are clearly in favour of the mandate
efficient in our support let me touch on a couple of things the commissioner also said about it
this is combining help on one hand for emergencies as the commissioner said and prevention for the future
support for people and also for the future
there can be a combination of those tools
i think the biggest thing is that we are enabling things to happen
we need to share info and for that we need all the platforms where we can easily share information and also where we can share the big data which is very important with the ict
that should be understood
it was an incredibly complicated time
so instead of blaming and criticising especially personally some people at the ` ecb ] we should appreciate what they did for the way our economy has got out of the crisis for the jobs they saved actually improving the situation in * europe ]
mr president in @ may two thousand and ten ] ` parliament ] voted for the single market to be perceived as a holistic unified project finding an equilibrium between an open sme friendly economy and a citizen 's social and basic rights
however this proud place comes with responsibilities
we need to look further we need to address the major large scale political question as well
they haven 't got a clue they don 't have a plan they will continue giving ! billions ] of our money to the % eu ] and are completely split on whether to carry out the result of the referendum or not
the ` tories ] have agreed to hand nearly ( gbp forty billion ] over to the % eu ] as a punishment for having a democratic decision to leave
the ) tories ] have had @ two years ] to come up with a position on # brexit ] and show us a blueprint of what an independent % britain ] would look like
the recent commission statement of estimates showed that the % uk ] will be handing over eur
this citizens charter would clearly outline citizens rights and obligations within the single market especially for ) european ] citizens who want to move sell shop and work across borders the urgent need for such an initiative was confirmed by the commission 's study on citizens top ! twenty ] concerns
the commission must now address these concerns by presenting the top ! twenty ] solutions as soon as possible to restore the crucial variable of credibility among citizens to the market
these measures would correct consumers and smes negative perceptions of the single market thereby boosting their participation in the market and reassuring the citizens that the % eu ] works for them
there is no way out and if he says well perhaps @ a month or two later ] i will not accept
the situation in the % drc ] is indeed terrible and it has been this way for quite a while and i am deeply concerned about the handling of the current issue with regard to the % kasai ] province
prepare the elections properly
i think we should not accept anything unless there 's really a broad consensus with all political stakeholders
i would like to see the high representative despite her comprehensive explanations and the commission take on an even more prominent role
and of course we took the decision in @ september two thousand and fifteen ] for the package of about ( eur four hundred and twenty million ] and of course it was done to directly support farmers and to see how we can leverage the supply and demand member states and commissioner } hogan ] will probably say something about it
it is also clear that it should be a joint effort a joint effort by the ` council ] the ` european parliament ] the ` european commission ] but also by the producers themselves
the situation in the agricultural markets in many of the member states is very difficult and severe especially in the dairy sector and the ` council ] is fully aware of this situation and shares the concerns of the farmers who have to cope with these difficult problems
that will be on the agenda of the # june council ] to be discussed by the ` council ] member states and the commission
are still implementing those measures
in @ march ] we took ! sixteen ] additional measures together with the commission and the ` council ] and those measures relate to intervention measures they relate to promotion measures to exports as well as the possibility for member states to give additional state aid
but also at the last council it was clear that many member states have stated that if we are again going to take additional measures they have to be linked to a reduction of milk production
you see an average increase of milk production of about between ! five ] and ! six ] but that is not the case in every member state so whilst stating that we need a ) european ] answer at the same time we need flexibility for the member states to implement measures which are suitable for the national circumstances
mr president i would like to thank all the members of ` parliament ] for their remarks but also for their suggestions and certainly the presidency will take them with us to our next discussion in the ` council ] of @ june ] because there we are going to discuss again the very severe situation in the dairy sector as well as the need for additional measures
i would like to reiterate what was said by commissioner } hogan ] that the commission and the ` council ] were not resting on their laurels
many measures have been taken not only in @ september ] but also in @ march ] and of course we see some effects of those measures perhaps not enough but there are effects of those measures and the situation could have been worse if we did not have taken those measures
and yes i would like to reiterate that we need a ) european ] approach
and it is clear that the ` council ] also stated that we do not want to go back to a quota system i agree with what was said by mr } huitema ] that we have to improve the situation of the farmers in the supply chain
we have to give them a fair price for their products
therefore the work of the market taskforce installed by the ` european commission ] is so important and in the # june council ] we have the ~ first ] report of this taskforce and hopefully we get some interesting and creative ideas
but at the same time of course we have to support those farmers and see how we can help them balancing supply and demand
it is not the ) dutch ] model of the ) dutch ] government but it is also the ) dutch ] model of the ) dutch ] dairy producers and they are looking into niche markets into improving quality into new market concepts
but they are also now at this moment discussing possibilities of reduction of the milk production in the % netherlands ] on a voluntary basis and i think it is up to the ` council ] in @ june ] to see how we can support those initiatives of farmers organisations to reduce the milk production
that 's always appreciated and i believe we have come up with a good report
because the patronising attitude that we 've had in the past has made us look ~ second ] or ~ third ] in line in terms of preference of many recipient states and that effects the notional validity of the partnership was well
in ! one ] of my amendments and supported by the rapporteur refers to the fact that member states ` europol ] and ` eurojust ] are not granted the possibility to communicate data to non member states and ~ third ] countries because of the absence of sufficient data protection in those countries
in my opinion the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analyses of the information contained in the system
the review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations due to the joint automated information system which will assist in preventing investigating and prosecuting serious contraventions of national laws
sometimes i have the feeling that there is a little too much of this innovative energy we in the ` green group ] believe that the report is an important one the aim of it is a very legitimate and crucial one for the time
had it been about unleashing the full potential of the & lisbon treaty ] in the field of security and defence we would have been in full support
it would be an agency without transparency parliamentary oversight let alone control we are in full support of centralisation it makes sense in this field but not in this way without any accountability whatsoever
~ secondly ] we believe that before committing large amounts of fresh money to defence and security we should explore the full potential of efficiency gains through cooperation and only after this should we consider additional funding that might be available through the % european union ] budget or from member states
these are the main reasons why our group is unable to support the report even though we are committed to a stronger ) european ] common defence and security policy and there are many very good ideas in the report in general
and aggressive fiscal planning
they have the potential to enable us to solve many of the critical problems confronting us
in order for it to be effective bridging the digital divide has to be mainstreamed into every other policy area in accordance with the ` united nations ] sustainable development goals
digital technologies have huge potential in terms of reducing poverty increasing the competitiveness of the economy and creating employment opportunities
the private sector needs to get involved and play a role through its expertise and innovation know how
at the same time a huge increase in mobile services is securing across the planet and the numbers of mobile users are now surpassing the numbers of people having access to electricity sanitation or clean water
in the european consensus on development which is a crucial document on development policy of the % eu ] and its member states we can find the bold statement that they will continue to support information and communication technologies in developing countries as powerful enablers of inclusive growth and sustainable development
we are all aware of the fact that in this area of developing cooperation public funding will not be sufficient for a truly transformative digitalisation process
according to the two thousand and sixteen world development report on digital dividends ! six billion ] people lack access to high speed internet and ! four billion ] still have no internet access at all
in order to realise these goals both developing countries and developed countries as well as all actors both public and private need to maximise and join their efforts
special attention has been given to supporting digital literacy and skills to empower people especially women and people in vulnerable and marginalised situations to promote social inclusion and to facilitate the participation in democratic governance and the digital economy
whereas digitisation is rapidly growing globally our partners from developing countries continue to lag behind losing the opportunity to fully utilise their human capital towards the achievement of the sustainable development goals
at a time when digitisation is growing fast this lack of access is a major challenge to development as it continues to widen gaps and inequalities in the world
if this potential is to be realised then we must find ways of turning these technologies into a resource for all people despite the challenges they face within their communities what does it mean
for this very reason there is a need for public private cooperation based on development principles
it does not work and i very much hope that we can take away the last exemptions allowing airports and harbours and so on to use these inefficient methods that make people feel bad
so i think this report is important
and how can you say that you will have a high level of protection when people leave cds with ! twenty million ] people 's data on them lying in cafs and when we know how easy it is to hack into computers i did it myself as a kid actually
then you look at the anti terror legislation with profiling and you see it creates insecurity and it creates problems for people living their daily lives you cannot combat terrorism with anti terror laws that create the same feelings of insecurity
we can see that it is neither efficient nor legal
the ) german ] surveillance scheme on ! eighteen ] @ forty year old ] ) muslim ] men in % germany ] was not efficient
the ` council ] needs to adapt its logic and spend the resources efficiently targeting specific individuals and focusing the time on them instead of going for ethnic registration which is in complete violation of any human rights standards
this matter is extremely important because from * europe ] we can make sure that the latest technology impacts on the usefulness and efficiency of road transport in all its forms
we need more data on the windscreens so that we can sort out our own salvations in a more effective and efficient manner
so often as elected members we journey round our constituencies and find ourselves in traffic jams and so often we have to make phone calls to find out what the situation is ahead
i wish mrs } jensen ] and the commissioner every success
madam president i speak as a civil engineer and my son has a transport surveying business stretching right through the % united kingdom ]
give it to the ) chinese ]
sell it
this is the key point when we talk about cohesion
this is exactly the moment when the governments should step in and some of them do but some of them do not
apart from that it does not make sense to repeat wrong things it does not make them more true
we will definitely not be financing military operations out of our budget in the future
rightly so this remains with the national budgets and with the national governments and parliaments but we have to become more efficient
this exercise is primarily a more efficiency exercise because if we plan together if we procure together if we train together that makes us more efficient in the tasks ahead
well in ` nato ] he could block everything if we had to rely on ` nato ] any veto from any member state would definitely block our access to ` nato ] resources
we need a certain amount of strategic and operational autonomy as the % eu ] in order to be able to do what we deem appropriate
finally sanctions are part of efficient % eu ] policies i propose that we should make these more efficient targeting concrete individuals responsible for breaking international laws and human rights violations
protection procedures are simplified
i would like to ask the commission and the ) greek ] government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation full implementation of % eu ] law will generate convergence in the quality of the interinstitutional framework with the best ) european ] countries
delayed payments regulation is a case where the ) greek ] economy would have big dividends to avoid future generation of non performing loans when the next crisis comes
it would also be good to understand how revenues from income tax have been lower in @ two thousand and seventeen ] than in @ two thousand and sixteen ] even though the economy of the country is growing
during the crisis under the threat and during the very limited time a new framework including the fiscal compact that we are debating @ today ] was created
spending money that people do not have is not a good policy
as the consequence countries soon after suffered with substantial difficulties and people have suffered
just looking at the data i would observe that in the * eurozone ] @ from two thousand and nine ] every year there was a decline of deficit to gdp
~ secondly ] what is the state of play on the member states competent authorities
mr president the roaming like at home rule was ! one ] of the most significant success stories of the % eu ] @ this year ]
now we have to take it ! one ] step further by expanding it to the * western balkan ] candidate states already during the accession negotiations
this would be beneficial to the economies too through market integration and better services
these include the sexual exploitation of ) syrian ] refugees by those delivering aid on behalf of the ` united nations ] and other well known international organisations
several countries including the % united kingdom ] and the % netherlands ] have announced investigations into the funding they provide to these and other international organisations and that they intend to make measures to prevent similar situations in the future
through its external financial instruments and the ` european development fund ] the % eu ] provides ( billions of euros ] in assistance to ~ third ] countries through international organisations among other channels
i therefore have a few questions for the high representative on a response from the % european union ]
~ first ] of all will the commission or the high representative order a thorough investigation to determine whether % eu ] funds have financed either directly or indirectly the organisations where sexual abuse has been established
~ secondly ] what is the response by the commission and the high representative to the abuse cases that have recently come to light
in order to combat and prevent sexual misconduct within international aid organisations is there room for guidelines within the % eu ] 's external financial instruments that would make funding strictly conditional upon respect for principles oversight guidelines accountability and regular reporting from beneficiaries on this issue
last but not least will the commission and the high representative consider working with member states such as the % united kingdom ] and the % netherlands ] to set up contact points in ~ third ] countries including in crisis zones for victims of abuse
they showed that with a more ambitious proposal the fuel saving would be much greater than the cost of a new vehicle the relative cost of the increase of the new vehicle
i am prepared to pay more taxes but they have to be fair and they have to be good taxes
we had control on control sometimes ! five ] times
the aim is to perform better and to show it simpler rules as the commissioner said to combine funds and this is i think the need for the future
so this is the aim
on control i think we made big steps forward
this is why to complement gdp the commission is investigating other indicators including demographic
exclusion in any form breeds resentment confrontation extremism and sometimes violence integration on the other hand is a promise of stability and of peace not to mention the economic contribution that migrants usually young people can bring to an ageing population
the moral leadership of * europe ] is important but it also acts as an example by showing that green business is very important for our competitiveness
in order to have such a global agreement in order to persuade other countries to come forward we have to keep pressing by our example an example which has its moral importance
this is why it is important to keep in mind that the international community will have to share those costs
the report is right in saying that without the contribution of developing countries our global efforts will fail
when discussing future actions aimed at keeping the rise in global average temperature below < two degrees ] above pre industrial levels we cannot ignore the fact that the least developed countries are not able to cover the costs of necessary investments in cleaner technologies
everybody knows that there are some pressing ) european ] issues like # brexit ] migration elections in some member states but we have to take the expectations of our partners in the * western balkans ] more seriously otherwise we might lose them
our common vision for the future of the % eu ] has to build on our most cherished asset which is our unity
if the rome declaration to be on the occasion of the # sixtieth anniversary of our european union ] will be about the vision of a multi speed * europe ] then it will become not less than the death certificate of the ) european ] project
a vision for the future must not formalise the present day frustrations
vat rules that were agreed @ seven years ago ] are having on micro enterprises that have taken advantage of the internet to set up small businesses
and one of his spokesmen sent you a tweet blaming the member states
do you think that is the right attitude for the commission to take or is it in conflict with their clear aim to create a digital single market
mr president i really want to say that day after day the situation in % turkey ] is reminding me and other people of my age who lived in the socialist system of the days of the beginning of stalinist terror but i suppose that now we are able to learn from history and to stop this development in % turkey ]
they are looking to us
of course i do understand the hardships for many ) europeans ] in this crisis
cutting welfare systems is painful but it is necessary to ensure stability and future growth
the national politicians should have acted much earlier in preventing the crisis they failed to react in time
blaming % brussels ] is sad to say a rather common way for national politicians and some others to escape their own responsibilities
politics is about responsibility and accountability
you can see improvements now
what i am saying is that the main responsibility for what happened in * europe ] lies in the capitals of * europe ]
i agree with you that the defence spending is of course awful as is the relationship with some of the neighbours
if you look at the great challenges of * europe ] they are migration and security solidarity or the lack of solidarity and growing inequalities
but having said that our group is also disappointed because here in ` parliament ] all of us are elected to prepare the future of * europe ] and that means getting into the concerns of * europe ] and you know very well what they are
so you do not need all these scenarios
you mentioned the social pillar and of course climate change
how do we move forward
now on every single member every single committee and every single body of this house must be involved
us that is why i thank the commission for having presented ! five ] different scenarios even knowing that none of them will be fully accepted
i cannot understand
we may have forgotten to explain that there is no alternative to the % union ] not in the past not now and not in the
i agree with president } juncker ] that the time has come to align expectation with reality
we may have forgotten where we come
west * europe ] belongs to all of
from we come from war death poverty and hunger we come from lack of freedom we may have forgotten why unity is so important
it to conclude this debate is necessary a debate about the future that we want for ourselves and for our children
what member states must do is to stop blaming * europe ] for what * europe ] cannot do because it does not have the tools
the question is simple how do we want to deal with those challenges
but also do we want to move forward this is a legitimate question too because i know that i want to move forward but we cannot simply blame those who do not want to go further than we are now by calling them ) antieuropean ] we are all ) europeans ] * europe ] belongs to all ) europeans ] no matter whether they come from the north the
they have to be confronted with their own responsibilities i think that this is a very important step to bring transparency democracy and legitimacy to this process of reforming the % european union ] in the near future finally i would like to
say that the ` epp group ] has approved its own strategy
reshaping the microcredit framework can help us reinforce and rebuild our economies from the community upwards
i think the economic crisis has forced us to take a long hard look at our past economic behaviour
i sincerely hope that following on from this excellent report we see significant and coordinated action at community level to support the invaluable work that is being done by and for microenterprise at local and national level around the % european union ] as it is a very important part of our economy @ today ] and a very important part of our economy into the future
addressing and improving access to microcredit offers us the opportunity to address these past mistakes
that in turn offers us an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes
looking onward to the future i can see that city continuing to expand on the basis of these well allocated well controlled funds i would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allocated managed and controlled because the private sector can always do a more efficient job than the public sector
i would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these monies have been to the rural areas of the * north west ] where there are a lot of agricultural areas which are vital to the whole economy
this is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation
~ secondly ] they must also be used to bring in private finance ~ thirdly ] because of different approaches from different member states we would like to look at whether it is feasible to have an % eu ] framework for non bank microfinance institutions
we have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with and particularly in the & ippc ] which we have talked about @ today ]
it could by itself be the biggest help for businesses in the % european union ]
ahead of voting on the legislation on novel foods we should recall the reasons for having been prudent and aware of risks for the health and welfare of animals
we know from our past experience with similar issues that tackle both food safety and ethical relations between humans as the dominant species and nature that public perception depends very much on specific knowledge of the matter
consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and injuries to farm animals and therefore they have the right to be informed about the potential of cloning to cause pain and to waste natural resources
yet the development of animal cloning as a method of food production is being pursued without public awareness
the problems with cloning do not concern just the welfare of animals but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in * europe ] food is produced to a very high standard
the eurobarometer study from @ last october ] documented serious public concerns with regard to hypothetical future use of food products from clones this is linked to the sale of imported food which could eventually be sold in * europe ] without being labelled as a product from cloned animals
i therefore agree with the rapporteur 's approach urging the commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clones
among other problems which have been covered by the amendments tabled by my political group i wish particularly to support the sharing of information from animal testing so as to avoid the need for new tests involving animals
this has to be visible and understandable not only among ourselves but also more and more outside
this all creates a nightmare for the budget negotiations
there is an ongoing tendency to cut as much as possible without any rationale while at the same time taking on new obligations new commitments
we have a unique situation to solve the problem at no expense to the member states
so now the reply awaited from the ` council ] is whether the ` council ] and the member states prefer to put this money in their own pockets and ignore the commitments they have made in the past and ignore the payments they have to make or do they want to really address the problem show their ) european ] will and pay the bills
the decision on the whole set of amending budgets could be made very easily
we spend @ days and days ] trying to figure out whether the ` council ] is going to respect its commitments or not
we will create additional tensions in the budgets for ! two thousand ]
we have to give it back to the member states
so it is clear that we will continue to have great partners within the % united states ] even if the ` federal government ] decides to stay on the side of the road
finally my last remark to his house is that the world 's reaction to president } trump ] 's action proved that the % european union ] is on the right side of history
united
we have heard many of our political leaders in * europe ] say that we will keep up the engagements in the & paris agreement ]
that is our goal
we have to add now but have been partially reopened
mr president it is positive that the % eu ] delegation in % geneva ] will give major priority to defending the universality of human rights against efforts from several countries to undermine this concept
more than ever it is crucial that the % eu ] supports the ` un human rights council ] financially and politically to ensure that it can continue to work independently
however i deeply regret that the ` council ] did not include a reference to the ` un ] & binding treaty on business and human rights ] the single most important normative process currently going on
i deplore that the % eu ] has not been constructive in the process and hope that the % eu ] will listen to the requests by the ` european parliament ] and give its full and unconditional support to the % un ] binding treaty process
mr president the ) maltese ] prime minister mr } muscat ] has predicted that the number of people crossing to * europe ] will reach record levels
most of these people will come from % libya ] to % italy ] via people traffickers as we know
the best way to stop these huge numbers of people illegally coming into * europe ] and to stop the large numbers of tragic deaths in the * mediterranean ] is surely to turn the boats back and process the migrants offshore
that is why ! six ] ) european ] countries have now been in private talks with % australia ] asking them which way to work things out because they know that the % eu ] way is failing
only @ today ] we have been warned by ) italian ] officials that ) jihadis ] are actually plugging the gaps in funding for their actual campaign by smuggling people into * europe ] because their oil money is running out
let 's go forward
we have been taking into account most if not all of the concerns that have been raised by analysing the previous trade deals with other countries and i think that we can say with great confidence that this trade deal is in many ways a golden standard for future trade deals in the world
it is not meant to do this and this is why i would like to say to those who are not listening to the facts but following the alternative news and not trying to go into depths of the analysis of this trade deal please do not bark up the wrong tree
thank you to % canada ] for this
it will deliver trade in goods and decreased tariffs
have been sending their soldiers since the # first world war ] to defend our freedoms and our liberties
& ceta ] is like a lighthouse for these guidelines for many who are searching for wealth and trade
so from that perspective i would say that every country just like my small country % latvia ] will benefit from this
the ~ first ] direction is protectionism provincialism decline and the building of walls
will we take the direction of protectionism and closedness or will we fight for liberal democratic values for growth and for the new golden standards of international trade
it is a unique chance for the % european union ] now to take again a leading position in the global economy and global politics and in many ways the vote for & ceta ] will decide this never before has the world needed such a strong * europe ] at this moment and it needs guidelines for good trade
do we really want it
of course the & ceta ] trade deal is not a cure a medicine for each and every disease
the world is watching the % european union ] and which direction we will take
they died in the # second world war ] for our freedoms and liberties and even now when the % european union ] is facing security challenges at its external borders ) canadian ] soldiers are again on our sandy beaches in northern * europe ]
geographic indications a lot of geographic indications for many of our producers and of course the investment part
the ~ second ] direction is openness to the world it is leadership it is effective decision making it is growth and finally also the bringing of wealth to our % union ] and each and every nation and member state here on the * european continent ]
it will deliver additional possibilities for services
i would say it is a judgment day because since @ two thousand and sixteen ] we have discussed in the ` european parliament ] more than ! eighteen ] times in different large groups what this trade deal really means for us
try to find other solutions for other existing problems but go forward with this deal
please do not switch off this light vote for ceta
it is comprehensive but it will not solve all the problems that our workers small and medium enterprises and people are facing
it is a good thing
this is because most of us believe & ceta ] is good for our economy particularly for smes and it does not threaten our choices values or laws
the ` sd group ] has tabled its own consensual resolution which clarifies what we mean by progressive trade agreements by spelling out clearly what we like about & ceta ] and what we do not like about & ceta ] and expect to be further corrected in & ceta ] where agreed or in future trade agreements more widely better provisions on sustainable development and a sanctions based approach
@ two thousand and fourteen ] we have voiced concerns demanded changes and achieved most of those already on the occasion of what was effectively the ~ second ] conclusion of the negotiations in @ february ]
the ` sd group ] has decided to vote in favour of & ceta ]
and improved transparency for all trade agreements in future
but it is also an act of trust and an offer of partnership towards the % eu ] institutions notably the commission and the ` council ] with which we want to work together for a better trade policy and towards % canada ] which is a country that shares our values our objectives and our hopes for a better future
we welcome as a group the fact that many of the citizens concerns have been addressed through clarifications and commitments from the commission and the ) canadian ] authorities through the joint interpretative instrument and the other instruments in the package ceta is not perfect far from it but it is an important step in the right direction a more progressive trade policy where the benefits are widely spread among all citizens
some ! twenty four million ] ) europeans ] are unemployed ! twelve million ] ) europeans ] are long term unemployed and ! five million ] unemployed ) europeans ] are under the age of
we the representatives of the people of * europe ] need to rethink labour market policies
if we want * europe ] and ) europeans ] to prosper in the @ twenty first century ] we must create a competitive ) european ] labour market and part of this is to avoid this mismatch
too many overly strong protectionist measures have blocked initiative flexibility and opportunities
this mismatch is unfortunate for many ) europeans ] who are out of work
it is unfortunate for our societies which miss out on wealth and prosperity
we need to promote flexibility
it is unfortunate for the businesses which cannot fill their vacancies
in too many places in * europe ] the labour market is rigid even static
this mismatch in the ) european ] labour market causes an uncompetitive ) european ] labour market
explosives and poisons
the fact is other than a small reduction in overall fuel usage there is no environmental benefit
@ in recent weeks ] we 've seen a lot of propaganda outlining the supposed environmental credentials of electro pulse fishing but the fact is that little independent non partisan science has been completed
we all wanted more in % rio ] but it is not true that nothing has been achieved
like mr } hoppenstedt ] this will be my last speech before this $ chamber ] @ after twenty years ]
it is quite clear that some key % eu ] policies will be undermined without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal
~ secondly ] we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because if they did they would of course be subject to the interinstitutional agreement on agencies
the ` budget committee ] recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency
finally we would not want the ` budget committee ] 's position to be in any way undermined by the rush for these proposals
with respect to equal pay for the same job
this house is still deliberating the approach to be taken for the revision of this directive
madam president i agree with mr } telika ] that it is really high time that we discuss this issue in the plenary session and i thank all colleagues and all members who brought up this question it is extremely important for consumers and for a wellfunctioning digital single market to have neutral independent access to the search systems of air transport services
transparency and neutrality in the search for flights increased competition and made travel within the % eu ] affordable for many ) europeans ]
we will continue a discussion on this subject in our working group on the digital single market which i chair and precisely during our next meeting on @ twenty two november ] and you are all invited to join us but let us not forget that this is not the only problem that consumers encounter when booking flights
they are often geo blocked and have to pay a higher price because of their place of residence or to put it more precisely because of the temporary location based on their ip address
the consumers cannot be discriminated against online and their choice of best offers cannot be restricted by business models
reminded us of this possibility
i think we should do more to protect local communities as well as the endangered species in the park such as the mountain gorillas and okapi
@ yesterday ] the committee received the high representative vice president of the commission mrs } mogherini ] who again stressed the link between development and security i would also like to stress here in this debate on the protection of the * virunga national park ] the link between development ecology and security
we call on the commission and the member states to further address the root causes of armed conflicts and corruption and to support sustainable development and peacebuilding strategies in the park and the surrounding region we also urge the commission the member states the
i recall that oil exploration and exploitation are not compatible with ` unesco ] world heritage status
! twenty five ] ! zero ] refugees came to * europe ] last year ! one third ] to % germany ] ! one third ] to my own country and the rest to the % european union ]
why not % syria ]
why not % syria ]
even and that 's particularly interesting when there 's no central authority in play
you could use it for digital rights management for music films or electronic football tickets
let me briefly explain to you what this is about
it has a lot of potential some people even liken it to the kind of revolution that was sparked by the introduction of the internet and i have to say although not all my fellow shadow rapporteurs are here we had a very exciting very interesting and frankly very enjoyable time
it 's virtual currencies and distributed ledger technology so one would be forgiven by thinking well this is a dull and somniferous subject that perhaps will gently put us into sleep at this @ late hour of the day ]
so what we advocate in the report is not to stifle innovation by regulating now but instead to closely monitor what is going on by the creation of a taskforce which we suggest should be created at the level of the commission and then to regulate
some of you may have wondered why it is so much cheaper to send an email or an sms than to transfer funds for example from somebody working in ! one ] country and sending remittances back home because in the end this transfer of funds is not much more than an electronic message even today but still it can be rather expensive ! seven ] or ! eight ] of the funds transferred
it could also be an interesting area for government applications fighting vat fraud or using it to implement an innovative land register of course with such new technology it is early days
this technology could help us to reduce these transaction costs significantly in the long run and i think that if we regulate well we might even have openaccess electronic wallets where the transfer of funds would be decided by some sort of leastcost routing
we are not at a stage where the risks that come with any such technology are systemic
but of course one would be wrong because this new technology has a lot of promise
fundamentally what this is about this distributed ledger technology that underlies the bitcoin which is the most prominent virtual currency is a decentralised database that keeps a record of any sort of transaction done within that database in a way that is surprisingly safe resilient and trustworthy
this technology can be used as the title of the initiative report would suggest for virtual currencies and in order to reduce the cost of financial transactions significantly
you could use this for clearing and settlement automatic contracts for example implementing derivatives on the distributed ledger far beyond the financial sector
i have lodged my papers with the ` court of first instance ] so i intend to fight a very robust case
all i would like to say is that the big fuss and bother about my parliamentary assistance expenses covered by the media over the last nine or @ twelve months ] has been a harrowing experience
i understand i have a very good case and along with that i have gone for interim measures which means that no money will be payable until the court has heard all the evidence and made the appropriate decision
i only heard the last ! ten ] words
moreover we have also succeeded in future proofing the legislation by introducing provisions on software updates and smart appliances and explicitly banning the use of defeat devices finally the label will be able to show information about for example durability or reparability thereby further helping consumers to save money and at the same time contributing to the objectives of the circular economy
close examination
focusing on energy efficiency first whether it is for buildings products or in industry is more important than ever in order to ensure security of supply and a successful energy transition while promoting investment growth and jobs
! two thousand eight hundred ] people and their families are now facing serious difficulties and are left without any income and even any hope
the minimum wage itself is not the problem
some people are claiming that the ) german ] application of the minimum wage is one of the most serious attacks on the single market since the adoption of the & single market act ] these protectionist measures create barriers all the way down through * europe ]
this is very serious and very worrying
coming from a country where the social partners actually do the collective bargaining i am not against a minimum wage but it is up to the partners to decide what the level should be
it was initially expected that emas registered companies would have performed better since the emas environmental requirements are tougher as compared with older and better known certificates such as iso
among them is a line in the definition of & emas ] which i saw as particularly important
now the problem is how modern technologies can be used for environmental protection and how industry or services should be helped in promoting the environmental value of the production
existing voluntary and regulatory instruments were not linked to each other in order to establish synergies
mr president ) european ] legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and obtain higher standards of energy efficiency and environmental compliance
from past experience we know that certificates at various levels were not sufficiently coordinated
ecolabelling as a part of the % eu ] action plan on sustainable production consumption and industrial policy is such a tool
~ first ] revision of the ` emas ] scheme was not encouraging
the goal of ecological certificates is to engage synergies with other legal acts that are tackling environmental aspects of the products
it is about striking a balance between regulatory and market based instruments with the aim of developing voluntary standards for various products and services or helping to optimise production processes and make more effective use of resources
it would help organisations to proceed more easily from iso to emas standards
! fourteen thousand and one ] yet emas registered companies were not performing better and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the iso
an impartial system of certification will be we suppose appreciated also by consumers i hope that this will help organisations to choose the most rational systemic approach in order to interconnect different fields of environmental protection
the % people 's republic of china ] is a global power with its all the means of a centralised powerful state
what i see @ today ] when i look at % hong kong ] is a big powerful regime trying to silence those who actually have the same dream as i had once when i started in politics @ twenty years ago ]
by imposing a screening mechanism the ) chinese ] government will disqualify candidates for the # two thousand and seventeen chief executive election ] who do not meet the government 's approval
i am one of those who engaged in politics at a really young age at @ sixteen years old ]
if we do not speak up when fundamental democratic principles are manipulated then we also send another type of message we tell those students that democracy is important for us and we are lucky that we can benefit from it inside the % european union ] but we do not really care if other people live in a democratic society or not
mr president there are many reports from various sources on the current situation in % hong kong ] but it is clear that the authorities are trying to manipulate and limit in some cases even violently the democratic process
when students peacefully protest for democratic and indeed human rights anywhere in the world they deserve to be backed up by us in the % european union ] as a global power of democracy
if we in this house are silent we approve of the message from the ) chinese ] government and that is why we have to protest and make sure that the demonstrators are actually seen and that we do not forget their deeds
~ second ] i do not believe in the ` minsk group ] but i believe that the % eu ] in the person of the high representative has the capacity to broker the negotiations
it has got to give the impression that it is in the driving seat to solve the problem
so we have a european economic recovery plan of which the car industry is a part
but in reality each manufacturer is going to look after itself as best it can and each country will look after its manufacturers as best it can
there is of course a possible case for some support some financial support to the car industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact
but this can only be decided at the national level because the support apart from the ` european investment bank ] mentioned by mr } verheugen ] can only be provided by national taxpayers but there is ! one ] thing that the % european union ] could constructively do here at least until the recession is over and that is to give
car manufacturers a break from environmental restrictions
the industry is already in serious trouble
these environmental and other standard restrictions make cars more expensive
you are helping to kill off an industry which is already in serious bother
in order to address concerns expressed by ` parliament ] the extension of the autonomous trade preferences is subject to % ukraine ] 's respect for the essential elements of the association agreement
the unilateral market access granted to % ukraine ] corresponds to the ~ first ] year of application of the schedule of concessions negotiated under the & dcfta ]
economic political security and territorial challenges i would like to thank ` parliament ] for the efforts already made to pave the way for a swift conclusion of the legislative procedure for this file in order to ensure that trade flows are not disrupted
in addition safeguard controls are in place to prevent market distorting surges impacting adversely on ) european ] companies and industry including the agriculture sector
as part of the @ twelve september ] outcome the commission also agreed to submit a proposal to extend until the @ end of two thousand and fifteen ] the autonomous trade preferences currently granted to % ukraine ] as they will otherwise cease to apply as of
expressed satisfaction when the association agreement was ratified
the proposal by the commission for such a delay was based on a clear request from % ukraine ] to take an initiative that would allow ratification of the association agreements to go ahead while leaving more time to discuss ways of addressing ) russian ] concerns arising from the implementation of the & dcfta ]
this outcome must be seen in the bigger political context
the current proposal simply extends the duration of those autonomous preferences by @ fifteen additional months ] thus maintaining the same preferences
most importantly from an economic point of view the autonomous trade preferences have a very limited impact on the % eu ] markets and yet at the same time they represent a gesture of tangible economic and political support to % ukraine ] in a difficult situation helping to address % ukraine ] 's difficult
% eu ] phytosanitary rules remain fully applicable to ) ukrainian ] products
let me recall the basic elements of these autonomous trade preferences
we must stand shoulder to shoulder with % ukraine ] in the face of the extremely difficult political and territorial challenges it faces but also in its process of reforms and economic modernisation
delays in the extension of trade preferences should indeed be avoided as this could have an impact on economic operators decisions to import goods from % ukraine ]
even retroactive application risks not fully repairing interferences with trade flows and would be cumbersome not only for the economic operators but also for our competent national customs authorities
it is certainly not neutral when it comes to women
the bottom line has been said here over and over again there has to be some stepping up of the work there has to be some binding measures
i hope and i expect the commission to take this on board because it also means a lot in who we are as a player on the global level
nobody else is going to take gender equality further as well as social rights in % eu ] trade deals if we don 't do it
we decide what is monitored and when and how and if
without the power to measure analyse and utilise fishing data the % uk ] will still be unable to formulate its own fisheries policies and will remain under the hegemony of the & cfp ]
this report is the trojan horse the cuckoo in the nest the ~ fifth ] column the hidden enemy within
sign up to this under the so called & great repeal bill ] which is no such thing and the % uk ] has lost ! half ] the battle to reclaim our own fisheries and waters before the negotiation has even begun
now we have the opportunity dear commissioner to take up full responsibility and ambition and take the side of ` parliament ]
our high level of ambition on renewables takes fully into account the recent spectacular cost reduction in solar panels and offshore wind
my understanding was that during the ) maltese ] presidency over @ the last couple of months ] there was an important paradigm shift in the whole migration and refugee issue a shift from just allowing ! millions and millions ] of migrants coming to * europe ]
towards treating the root causes and treating the whole issue locally
what is the policy of the % european union ] following the ) maltese ] presidency this kind of paradigm shift is what my country % hungary ] has been fighting for for a long time and we shall never give up
the benefits of globalisation do indeed have to reach all citizens and all communities
i strongly believe that the % eu ] can make a difference in the essential fields of labour rights and environmental protection amongst others and also through its tsd chapters in our ftas
in conclusion to all that work i can share the ` epp group ] 's view that we see sanctions as a lastresort mechanism and would appreciate turning towards more effective ways to deal with the problem at hand
the experience gathered so far at the global level shows that traderelated sanctions fall short of delivering the desired results
we do not see conclusive evidence that sanctions could lead to an improvement of the effectiveness and the implementation of the tsd chapters
the way forward is to consolidate these chapters and to strive for the more effective and sustainable implementation of this important pillar in our valuebased trade policy
that being said to address any doubts that may arise during this debate the mfa is not an unconditional support
i believe that our common goal is to help % ukraine ] but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation
to be dispersed as medium and long term loans the assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in % ukraine ] which is done by agreeing with the ) ukrainian ] authorities a memorandum of understanding
this means that the rapporteur does not support any amendments tabled to the plenary and recommends closing the file at ~ first ] reading to end i would like to underline once again that this report is just a legal base for the commission to disburse the
~ third ] the reform process which has been important but is not really steady until now
therefore it is crucial that the ! two ] unfulfilled anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions
a step in the right direction is the adoption of the law on the high anti corruption court this @ last week ]
in that context i would like to highlight ! three ] key elements
if corruption is not addressed drastically mfa funds should not be delivered to % ukraine ]
in addition the newly adopted law was signed @ yesterday ] by the president of % ukraine ] the rapporteur welcomes this news with great satisfaction it means that ) ukrainians ] take the commitment seriously
~ first ] the worsening conflict and casualties in the east of % ukraine ] and all the many socio economic consequences of this aggression ~ second ] the economic recovery which remains fragile
hence the need for support for these reforms in the context where many interests can play against especially in pre election years
money but they will do so only when ) ukrainians ] manage to fulfil all the agreed and outstanding conditions
there are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve economic stabilisation and support the reforms it is very important to remind that the commission cancelled the last tranche of the ~ third ] mfa programme when some of % ukraine ] 's commitments were not fulfilled
in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation this is the ~ fourth ] time that the commission proposes macrofinancial assistance for % ukraine ] since the beginning of the war in @ two thousand and fourteen ] this time the commission proposes ( eur one billion ]
if we are serious about our goal we cannot slow down the procedures
this memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the disbursements of the funds
i am very grateful that we are where we are now indeed % ukraine ] needs this support and it deserves this support and it is very appropriate to have this next programme now
i am grateful to the commissioner that you although it is not included in the joint declaration explicitly referred to that because that is what it is also about
we need to be very clear in this regard
however the eternally crucial issue remains that of the implementation
we recommend taking advantage of the ) lithuanian ] presidency and the # eastern partnership summit ] in % vilnius ] as an opportunity to improve relations with % belarus ] as soon as all political prisoners have been released of course and to restart the political dialogue on inter alia democratic reforms free and fair elections and respect for human rights
however for what is probably the ~ first ] time we are discussing % belarus ] and its relations with the % eu ] not by reacting to the frequent negative news from this country but rather by trying to analyse the situation and thus propose concrete policy actions i would like to thank the ! twenty five ] colleagues
therefore we urge % belarus ] to lift any obstacles and restrictions to the exercise of freedoms of association expression movement peaceful assembly thoughts for the democratic opposition and ngos
it is a very important instrument and should be used for strengthening people 's understanding of the need for reforms and for the development also of an appropriate social net
i believe that all these and other artificial barriers should be broken down as soon as possible
we recommend encouraging the wider civil society including trade unions and business representatives as well as the political opposition alongside officials to increase their involvement in the dialogue on modernisation
some influential ) european ] politicians believe that % belarus ] is lost to the % eu ]
we suggest that this should be done in a very thorough way in order to improve their effectiveness and adapt their scope nature and validity reacting to the developments in that country
do we really need in order to build a democracy in the % european union ] to have a topdown elite selected and co opted by ) european ] parties or what is really very dangerous put forward by ) european ] movements of national parties
if we are not a federation why should we have a joint constituency that not even federations have
they must take ~ second ] place play ~ second ] fiddle to the needs of our ports and our boats
it is obvious to everyone that the current system is unfair and has a devastating effect on honest taxpayers including small and medium sized enterprises therefore i cannot see any reason why we should not act in order to change the situation
@ a few weeks ago ] ! one ] team ` manor racing ] became the latest to collapse after administrators could not find a buyer smaller teams in ` formula one ] are punished by rules that guarantee bigger teams prize money even if they finish last
colleagues you may think [ formula one ] is just for petrol headed adrenaline junkies but actually it is important for our economy as well
@ last december ] ` foundem ] the ~ first ] complainant in the shopping case had to close its shopping comparison website and ` yelp ] also closed its ) european ] businesses
you need to show companies that they cannot be rewarded for losing time because in the last two years ` google ] 's attitude and behaviour has caused more damage to complainant companies
when it comes to remedies may i suggest that all companies sit down with their technological experts together with the commission to try to find nondiscriminating future proofed remedies thank you very much
let me remind you that time helps monopolies and damages smes
madam president dear colleagues dear high representative i 'm looking at these issues especially as a spokesperson for security and defence from the ` ppe group ] and in this specific policy area it is so obvious that the % us ] is and will remain an indispensable partner
we call for responsible engagement on key issues such as ` wto ] reform and climate change to name but ! two ]
he has made no effort at all to speak with the ` efdd ] as a group
madam president our group is clearly committed to transparency and accountability especially in the use of public funds
a party represented by ! one ] mep still needs to be represented in at least ! a quarter ] of the member states in order to be registered
we want to make sure we make it more open and inclusive less formal and rigid
this is very good news as an important element of the strategy 's success is to ensure everybody is on board
that is why we propose enhancing coordination at all levels through the establishment of a % european union ] youth coordinator and the design of national action plans
citizens cannot go on being disillusioned at ! one ] summit after another
services and professional qualifications directives consumer redress and smes incentives
lack of proper transposition and information potential of the digital market
otherwise for citizens unless there is this realisation this will become nothing more than a meaningless tired buzzword
this resolution is a call for economic growth but in my opinion it is also an indication of the frustration which ` parliament ] and perhaps also the commission is experiencing vis vis the effective completion of the single market
we are already feeling unfortunately the effects of protectionism in various ways
however and most importantly it must be a market which is credible well understood and trusted by citizens providing ) europeans ] with a realistic and holistic action growth plan in order to achieve a truly competitive inclusive and social economy
time is running short and the continued unity and integration of the market are being seriously threatened
the relaunch of the economy and the single market will need the continued impetus and input and hopefully the leadership of the commission and the committed ownership by the member states
once again we are discussing the potential of the single market but citizens are tired of rhetoric and instead want to see the realisation of this potential because the single market is very vital for the % european union ]
it would be deeply sad if in the @ fifth year ] of this legislature we were to find ourselves churning out yet another resolution on the single market and debating the same problems that were identified in the @ first year ] amongst others the fragmentation and inadequate application of rules
it is high time the ` council ] came up with more coordinated urgent specific solutions and decisions concerning the crisis created after all by the irresponsible behaviour of some banks this ` parliament ] and the commission especially commissioner } barnier ] have been making specific proposals and initiatives yet we seem to move very slowly
we had an ambitious and thoughtful ` parliament ]
now for the ~ first ] time we had an ambitious proposal by the commission
delayed payments regulation is a case where the ) greek ] economy would have big dividends to avoid future generation of non performing loans when the next crisis comes
i would like to ask the commission and the ) greek ] government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation full implementation of % eu ] law will generate convergence in the quality of the interinstitutional framework with the best ) european ] countries
it would also be good to understand how revenues from income tax have been lower in @ two thousand and seventeen ] than in @ two thousand and sixteen ] even though the economy of the country is growing
on the future of % poland ] and * europe ] state capture by a single party is not the future
i supported the ` solidarity ] movement in @ the eighty s ] when the ) polish communists ] denounced us as zgniy zachd the rotten west today when i read a translation of programmes on your public tv and radio i 'm getting the impression that we are already close to zgniy zachd again when we insist on the rule of law and the separation of powers when respect for your own constitution is demanded
i wonder can you explain to me how a simple law can overrule an explicit provision in the & constitution ] with regard to the duration of the mandate of a judge in the ` supreme court ]
you said we should listen to citizens and to their concerns
yet at the same time you talk to us about a marshall plan for africa when poland is a country which has no development ministry no development agency and invests
the aim is to perform better and to show it simpler rules as the commissioner said to combine funds and this is i think the need for the future
we had control on control sometimes ! five ] times
on control i think we made big steps forward
so this is the aim
they haven 't got a clue they don 't have a plan they will continue giving ! billions ] of our money to the % eu ] and are completely split on whether to carry out the result of the referendum or not
the ` tories ] have agreed to hand nearly ( gbp forty billion ] over to the % eu ] as a punishment for having a democratic decision to leave
the ) tories ] have had @ two years ] to come up with a position on # brexit ] and show us a blueprint of what an independent % britain ] would look like
the recent commission statement of estimates showed that the % uk ] will be handing over eur
madam president we all know that % nigeria ] is a huge country the most populated country in * africa ] and we all know that it is devastated by injustice and violence not only on religious grounds but also on social economic and political grounds
that is why it happens that % nigeria ] is ! one ] of the ! five ] priority countries of the migration partnership and in that context i myself have been a member of a delegation to % nigeria ] on a number of occasions with some other colleagues here
migration illicit migration routes is at the origin of massive and gross human rights violations aimed mostly at women and defenceless children
this resolution tackles the call on the fight against ` boko haram ] and its terrorism but also addresses the ) nigerian ] authorities calling for reform of the security forces to make sure that they prevent extrajudicial executions arbitrary detentions and torture and reform of the criminal judicial system to make sure that the law is enforced to fight violence terrorism and corruption which is massive in % nigeria ]
* europe ] has probably never needed solidarity and equality more than today
a single set of rules
my only concern is that cohesion policy remains the main investment policy for the % european union ] that it carries on supporting growth and improving the conditions of investment
in @ two years ] ! one hundred ] concentration camps were in place
@ one hundred years ] of communism in practice equals roughly ! one hundred million ] victims it was and still is a system which is based on ! two ] pillars violence and lies
i can i try but she might not like it very much
we are still optimistic about this very complicated programme and on behalf of the ` epp group ] i can say that i fully support his stand
the internal situation remains extremely complicated but we must understand that it is our shared worry and shared responsibility
the major problem remains national reconciliation which means serious efforts to develop inclusiveness and mutual trust
we do not even know if he is still alive
it is a tragedy that this can go on year after year without anything happening
this film gives additional arguments as to why } dawit isaak ] must be released immediately
now it is time for implementation
this would allow us if the government has the willpower to control our own borders not pay a membership fee and not have to comply with % eu ] regulations and directives
certain politicians whom i don 't have to name here in this speech should hang their heads in shame because of their dangerous and reckless policies which have allowed jihadis to cross our borders freely without checks
mr president first allow me to congratulate you on your election
we are the % united kingdom ] the ~ fifth ] largest economy in the world
we have links all over the globe to the * anglosphere ] the commonwealth the emerging markets of the * far east ]
i am however glad that the prime minister made it clear that we are leaving the single market
i think it 's interesting that the conclusions of the ` council ] meeting raised the issues of migration and security because these ! two ] issues go handinhand as has recently been shown by the attacks on our continent
i am also concerned that there was no mention of immediate immigration controls which means that by the time we are fully out of the % eu ] on current trends we could have another ! million ] people come into our country from the continent
what should be on our to do list
it is authorised by a ` un security council ] resolution it complements the efforts of the ` african union ] force
that is why our group argues that we should be more ambitious so that in @ two thousand and twenty ] we will reduce our emissions by ! thirty ] instead of ! twenty ] and in @ two thousand and thirty ] we will need an equally ambitious target
it concluded that science tells us that if we do not fundamentally change the way we consume and produce energy now then we risk having a temperature increase of ! four ] within @ sixty years ]
now it holds in its hands the very future of these negotiations for an agreement in @ two thousand and fifteen ] for @ one whole year ]
madam president dear colleagues dear high representative i 'm looking at these issues especially as a spokesperson for security and defence from the ` ppe group ] and in this specific policy area it is so obvious that the % us ] is and will remain an indispensable partner
we call for responsible engagement on key issues such as ` wto ] reform and climate change to name but ! two ]
mr president we the members of the ) socialist and democratic ] family in this house truly care about the rule of law separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary and of course we understand the legitimate concerns every time there is a risk of breach of the rule of law in relation to a judicial reform in a member state
that tells you all you need to know about the ` uk independence party ]
the commission should analyse all possibilities in order to ensure that all operational programmes resubmitted after the deadline of @ twenty four november two thousand and fourteen ] are taken into consideration in order to conclude the inter service consultation by the @ end of the year ] and be treated as ready for adoption if they fulfil the quality requirements
what can be done to ensure that the revision process goes smoothly and is finalised before @ one may two thousand and fifteen ] as specified in & article nineteen of the multiannual financial framework ] regulation so as to avoid losing uncommitted amounts from
but the programming stage is still far from being finalised
what is the commission 's current position regarding the treatment of commitments for operational programmes co financed by the european regional development fund the european social fund the european agricultural fund for rural development the european maritime and fisheries fund and the cohesion fund which will not be adopted by the end of
moreover for programmes not ready for adoption by @ thirty one december two thousand and fourteen ] @ two thousand and fourteen ] commitments can only be preserved by rebudgeting uncommitted amounts from @ two thousand and fourteen ] in accordance with & article nineteen of the multiannual financial framework regulation ]
as a direct consequence there will be a significant delay in the actual start up of project implementation
only a limited number of operational programmes have been adopted and according to the latest information available only just over ! one hundred ] programmes will actually be adopted by the @ end of this year ]
however this implies a revision of the multiannual financial framework on the basis of a commission proposal with the ` council ] 's agreement and ` parliament ] 's consent
what were the main problems encountered and by which member states
however @ two thousand and fourteen ] should not be a lost year as regards investments from the ! five ] ) european ] structural and investment funds in this context i would like to table the following question
@ two thousand and fourteen ] in this connection does the commission envisage taking any measures to facilitate implementation of the operational programme
we have together reinforced the legal framework for protection of the % union ] 's financial interests achieving significant
it distorts competition sometimes it helps to finance illegal activities and if losses are too high it can push up the tax rates in other categories
i am glad that an important part of the proposal is the simplification of tax compliance especially for small and medium sized businesses
i believe that better collection of taxes should not be used for increasing the government revenues
in my view money gained should be invested mainly in the reduction of public debt and the reduction of the most devastating taxes for the economic growth
i am not going to go through all the details but we are able to support many elements of the ! three ] different scenarios worked out in the package
somebody should do the planning for ! four ] structures and it would be better if those who do this planning were answerable to somebody possibly a parliamentary body at the same time
standard setters academics and experts
we think that the concept of public good for the & ifrs ] should be clarified as well as the potential conflict between the private nature of the ` iasb ] the standard setter and the public good nature of the & ifrs ] that are applied @ today ] in more than ! one hundred and ten ] countries and jurisdictions
let me focus on the main points of this report
in @ january two thousand and seventeen ] the commission proposed the instrument that we are discussing today a macrofinancial assistance package covering approximately ! twenty five ] so only ! a quarter ] of the country 's financial needs as identified by the ` imf ]
if done properly it is my strong belief that these reforms have a high potential systemic impact
to conclude in its current form the decision gives us the green light if we vote positively @ tomorrow ] for the aid to % moldova ]
the result has been even stronger conditionalities attached to the disbursement of each of the ! three ] instalments
( eur sixty million ] would be a loan and ( eur forty million ] would be a grant to be disbursed in ! three ] instalments in @ two thousand and seventeen ] ideally and in
the other ! two ] institutions have accepted { one hundred percent ] of our requests the agreement reached during the # trilogue ] also includes a joint statement by ` parliament ] the ` council ] and the commission recalling that the necessary precondition for the disbursement of the assistance is respect for effective democratic institutions
the ambitious programme of reforms will cover financial sector governance public sector governance the fight against corruption the fight against money laundering energy sector reforms and improvement of the business and investment climate
i have come up with this proposal to adopt this joint statement in order to address the concerns of colleagues in this house regarding the recent initiative by the authorities to change the electoral system in the % republic of moldova ]
the principle is no reforms no money
the joint statement puts a strong emphasis on the fact that the consideration by the ) moldovan ] authorities of the recommendations of the ` venice commission ] will be part of the regular monitoring of the respect for the aforementioned precondition
however it does not mean immediate disbursement
we have clarified that conditions are to be attached to the disbursement of each and every ! one ] of the ! three ] instalments that benchmarks should be clear as required by the ` european court of auditors ] and that the assistance shall be immediately suspended or terminated if the conditions are not met
this is in order to address the short term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities of the ) moldovan ] economy the proposed assistance therefore amounts to ( eur one hundred million ]
these are reforms that will discipline and constrain the exercise of power by the government and any other economic or political actor for generations to come
mr president i would like first of all to thank the commission for the very clear stance on the joint statement adopted by the ! three ] institutions and the intention stated here publicly beyond doubt to properly enforce it
in order for a country to be competitive it cannot be corrupt it does need to address corruption so i believe we are doing the right thing with the * dcft ] on the one hand and with properly addressing and incentivising the fight against corruption % moldova ] that is indeed the right thing to do
i would also encourage the ) moldovan ] authorities to truly reach out to the opposition and to civil society and engage in this discussion if the discussion continues on the transformation of the electoral system but i also encourage the other parties to accept the invitation for dialogue
a proper democracy requires loyal democrats on all sides
if we look at the current situation for customers no real safeguards exist against flight cancellations or delays
how do passengers really feel when they book a ` ryanair ] flight but they don 't know whether it will ever take off and then the company blames poor planning of staff holidays it is not only the customers who are affected it is also the crew members who work on an hourly rate and don 't get paid when flights get cancelled
what are the workers social conditions if they are only being paid for the hours when they are flying with no income security when flights are cancelled
is this the model of aviation we want in * europe ] or elsewhere a new model of legal slavery
i saw him on television
there was ! one ] main weakness however in that proposal which is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date i believe that to be a major flaw
her car was destroyed but she walked away relatively unhurt this was because the car she was driving had the most modern safety features and this enabled her not to be seriously injured
however in the current circumstances of the car industry given that cars are not being sold it was quite clear in the discussions we had with the ` council ] that in fact @ twelve months ] was probably unrealistic and we had to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tyres
as mr } harbour ] and the commissioner have pointed out simplification is part of this proposal and that is very important finally i would draw attention to what we have done in terms of demanding greater emphasis in road services on reducing noise
that is the context in which we are discussing this report
that is why i proposed to the committee and the committee accepted an amendment stating that tyres that did not meet the standards after the implementation date should be sold off after @ twelve months ]
i would bring to the attention of this house that none of those ! three ] is a woman
i think it is very strange that the commission cannot come up with ! one ] single woman who is competent for one of these authorities
it still has the second largest military spending in the world and it has a technologically advanced and innovative defence sector yet we are still unable to translate these opportunities into a workable and coherent security policy
the technological military and economic logic of a more integrated % eu ] defence policy is inescapable but the problem is exclusively political
so one thing is totally different from the other then let me tell you something that is very important
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly the security defence and political challenge that % russia ] poses for the % european union ]
we seriously disagree with that just witness the political meddling in the # brexit ] process or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the east to consider and this is not an issue for ` nato ] 's eastern flank this is a larger concern to that we need to deal with the ~ second ] and probably much more important
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this file as it stands now
this is an obligation for a bilateral individual response between member states
thank you very much
i don 't think i need to remind my honourable colleagues that this particular article is not traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response
the present commission
in my last > few seconds ] i would like to call upon my colleagues to make sure that we deliver a broad majority for a strong proposal and do not take it apart during the vote on @ wednesday ]
the % eu ] is the world 's largest provider of development and humanitarian assistance and with the adoption of & agenda two thousand and thirty ] @ last september ] in % new york ] we all committed to the implementation of the new sustainable development goals
as the situation in * europe ] has deteriorated dramatically i think that the new sustainable development goals should take a step further and adopt strong objectives to reflect the enormity of the crisis while addressing the root causes of migration in the countries of origin
we want to make sure that the funds achieve their purpose to build sustainable economies health services and educational facilities create jobs and give a future to people in their own countries
madam president development policy is key in achieving a more inclusive and peaceful world by uniting global efforts to improve people 's lives worldwide and eradicate poverty
i think we are in a situation where we should raise public awareness in * europe ] on the question of the research programme and specifically of its importance for jobs and growth my question is since we are now in the midst of the discussions in the trialogue on that issue what is your
following the # arab spring ] the international shareholders of the ` ebrd ] decided to increase the callable capital so that the bank could extend its operations into countries such as % egypt ] initially the matter was considered non controversial and the ` european council ] did not amend the proposal
the result is a far stronger text which recognises the responsibility of the representatives of the % eu ] shareholding in the ` ebrd ] and reinforces the reasons for and the direction of our involvement in this institution
about beneficiaries and the impact of its financial intermediary operations furthermore as a result of the committee 's amendments the governor of the ` erbd ] for the % union ] should now report annually to ` parliament ] on the promotion of the % union ] 's objectives with regard to the % eu ] 's external action policy the & europe two thousand and twenty strategy ] and the significant increase in transfer to renewable energy
in the resolution we also address the case of the leading civil society activist } sombath somphone ] who disappeared in @ december ]
@ two thousand and twelve ] he was allegedly abducted by the police and we have still not seen any reaction from the % laos ] government
in compliance with the opinion of @ august two thousand and seventeen ] of the ` un working group on arbitrary detention ] we call for their immediate and unconditional release
i welcome the idea of a lead state which was announced recently
mr president virtual transaction systems are constantly being improved in order to save time and effort for users but their security is in my opinion a reason to remain vigilant
many people are easily tricked into revealing personal information online and into making unsecure transactions with ~ third ] party entities
that is why i think the most important measures which should be taken are raising user awareness regarding internet transaction security
in the midst of this ) european ] debt crisis we always take the decision to fish to consume more now and create debt for the future
we have a very intensive @ five months ] behind us but i am really proud to have been a part of this process we have achieved a lot together this regulation is a good example of what the % european union ] can achieve if there is enough political will
under the new regulation the management of the external borders of the % european union ] will be the shared responsibility of the member states and the % european union ]
! one ] of the priorities of our group was ensure that the agency had a bigger role in search and rescue at sea
this situation will be improved by the new regulation
search and rescue operations will be an important component of ) european ] integrated border management
the agency starts by supporting member states in carrying out these operations
i know that there are those who are not convinced about this new agency
i share some of their concerns
this crisis has been brought about as we all know by a kind of casino capitalism crony capitalism and a financial services sector that has been subject to no regulation or to light touch regulation as it is sometimes politely referred to the fall out of all of this for workers and families across * europe ] has been nothing short of catastrophic i have been struck in the debate and in the reports that have been produced by the very polite way in which we are addressing this scandal
the fact is that the % eu ] response to the financial crisis has been sluggish and minimalist
i am struck by the fact that the ) liberal ] and ) christian democrat ] groups are concerned at over prescription or that protectionism may be introduced through the back door
the fact is that we do require a protectionism and those that must be protected are workers and the real economy
we found ourselves in an academic debate a professional debate and a political debate
we have clear commitments regarding annual assessments of the work done by these ! three ] organisations
public money ( eur forty three million ] will be used to co finance three non profit organisations which deliver public goods the ` international financial reporting standards foundation ] which through the ` international accounting standards board ]
the ` public interest oversight board ] which oversees international audit ethics and education standards for the accounting professions and the ` european financial reporting advisory group ] the technical adviser of the ` european commission ]
this is about the quality of financial information in the decision making process
develops international financial reporting standards
the question of independence of the standard issuers and the governors of these organisations
the ` ifrs foundation ] and the ` icb ] will take measures for interest disclosure in order to avoid conflicts of interest
and where appropriate proposals for ias regulation changes
we have now created insurance schemes and other schemes to deal with the impaired assets
* europe ] has led the way in so many other areas it is now time to lead the way in creating the global institutions that will deal with the global problems we have and provide global solutions
the answer is we must do that
whatever the views in this ` parliament ] i think people have to face up to that as well
i believe that whatever the different views expressed in this ` parliament ] there is a will across the peoples of this world to do that and we * europe ] can play a major role in it
the world has changed fundamentally and we need institutions that reflect a global economy in the way they operate and deal with the problems we have
we had domestic competition
the ~ second ] thing we have to realise despite all the different political views in this ` parliament ] is that global cooperation not just in banking institutions but global cooperation in other areas in fiscal and monetary policy and in trade has to be a very important part of how we approach the future
there are global problems that need global solutions
more manufacturing is being done in * asia ] than in * europe ]
other countries have now done that
we found that banks that we thought were independent were completely entangled with other banks in different countries and we have to deal with that problem
for us to sit apart to be aloof not to cooperate with other countries is a recipe for failure and for an inability to solve a problem that is actually a global banking failure that has spread across the industrial economy
if we do not understand the problem we will not be able to understand the solution we had a power cut right across the banking system right across the world
~ first ] of all that it is important that the world comes together to deal with this crisis
whatever the party political lines that people want to adopt on this this is the truth we have to deal with the problem of global banking restructuring
we recapitalised our banks
we have got to do that i believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy
like it or like it not the world is changing incredibly fast
i was asked whether i would ensure or try to ensure that the ` international monetary fund ] had the resources necessary to deal with the problems of economies that could not at the moment sustain themselves when there was a flight of capital
the ~ third ] thing that comes out of this discussion for me is that to have global solutions to global problems we will also need not just our ) european ] institutions to be strong but our global institutions to be strong
more than ( a trillion dollars ] has been spent on recapitalising banks across the world
that will require us to shape global institutions and my message to this ` parliament ] is very clear
i was asked whether the ` world bank ] and other international institutions can help countries where there is substantial poverty being created as a result of the crisis
there is trade round the world at a speed that we have never seen before until this crisis and we have to deal with that by creating a global trading environment which is free but also fair
this is a test of how we having over @ the last sixty years ] created a * europe ] which has social protection as well as economic progress can help shape a world where we have economic progress environmental care and social justice at the same time
mr president all member states have very distinct legal cultures
the legal system of the % uk ] is very different to the rest of continental * europe ]
a blanket policy cannot work in this % union ]
it saddens me to see that this report is calling on the commission to urge member states to ensure the strict enforcement of % eu ] rules on the free movement of persons the % eu ] cannot force an % eu ] migration policy on countries which are already dealing with very difficult internal problems such as housing and financial commitments
i also note with concern that the emphasis of this report is on bringing sovereign nation states back into line
the report 's references to ensuring the % eu ] institutions themselves comply with % eu ] law could almost be obligatory
this is not a periphery matter
this report like the % eu ] institutions themselves has failed to consider who guards the guards
this was a sign of mutual respect
congratulations especially to the commissioner for his commitment and his tough tone which led to the @ one march ] agreement and calmed the situation
we have been following the developments very anxiously in % brussels ] and in * europe ] and the % eu ] has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediator between the parties
@ last december ] only @ two months ] after the positive commission progress report we experienced a major political crisis in the % former yugoslav republic of macedonia ] the opposition was kicked out of the plenary journalists had been expelled previously and voting took place without their presence
let us continue to work hard keeping the country on the ) european ] track
the whole political process was disrupted due to parliamentary blocking for @ many weeks ]
this is very much deplorable but my problem is that this debate is somewhat out of the context of urgency because at the same time we know that during @ this year ] in % iran ] ! ten ] times more people have been executed
% kuwait ] and % bahrain ] decided to have a moratorium on executions for @ the past six years ] and this is something encouraging
it is the only way people have to express their views about upcoming projects
the commission proposal is reinforcing this directive
furthermore we ask for more social participation
that tells you all you need to know about the ` uk independence party ]
if you want to get rid of all these problems you mention this is not the right way
it will increase costs and will be less competitive for the ) european ] market and for the smes that you believe that you are protecting
this compromise thanks to the determination and hard work of many of us will bear good fruits
i am asking for your broad support in the vote @ tomorrow ]
we proved today that the % european union ] can deliver concrete results for citizens all over * europe ] bringing positive changes in our daily lives but for the full completion of the digital single market we still need many reforms and a lot of work
we need to do our best to break down national silos
there is no place for protectionism in our common ) european ] market
the next step we should take is harmonisation of the vat rules we also need to unify copyright protection rules and open up the services market in the audio visual sector
i hope that the ` council ] will help us in these efforts as for us in ` parliament ] i hope to see this project at the forefront of our agenda
already now i am looking forward to the review in @ two years ] which you have just mentioned mr vice president
@ two thousand and seventeen ] this forum will enable for the ~ first ] time an exchange of views between all concerned actors such as consumer representatives industry at various stages of the supply chain member states authorities and the commission some of you have called on the commission to propose a specific legislation to prohibit dual quality
the commission intends to provide the results of this mapping for the next ` sherpa ] meeting of the high level forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain on @ twenty june ] in line with a conclusion of the ` european council ] of @ nine march ]
so far the commission has received ! twenty one ] replies from the member states
the establishment of a simple effective and transparent evaluation mechanism complementing the current & schengen ] evaluation is a most welcome initiative
early elections would be a sensible short term compromise in such a dramatic standoff offering both sides a democratic solution
minister the members of the council should not appeal to the principle of subsidiarity since we are dealing with ) european ] elections not with local regional or national elections we the ` greens efa ] consider that the ` parliament ] 's electoral law resolution has been very shy
without showing a true ambition to update the electoral system according to the new social and political demands for greater participation accountability and equality
we understand the urgency of producing a new law on the important subject of the ) european ] elections
our electoral rules
as it is the institution taking the final decision on ratification by the % european union ] of any international treaty
however the quality of the ` council ] decision depends to a large extent on the quality of the proposal submitted to it
as i have said any discussion on competence is a very difficult and sensitive one
we have had several rounds of discussion in an attempt to find a solution
to find ! one ] flexibility needs to be shown by everyone and i will repeat that by everyone
a measure that could significantly facilitate unblocking the situation is a legislative proposal by the commission to adapt the % eus ] legal framework to the & marrakesh treaty ] ahead of the ` council ] decision on the conclusion of the & marrakesh treaty ]
what would not be helpful or productive is to suspend our discussions to start lengthy court procedures
i will conclude by saying that the & marrakesh treaty ] has been included on the agenda of the ` foreign affairs council ] that takes place on @ monday next week ]
you should not be able to set the agenda or frame our political responses let alone frame our future you should stop putting people against each other and stop lying about migrants and refugees and you should stop confusing migrants and terrorists
it is beyond all dignity and sense
smugglers exist because there is a lack of legal pathways
to externalise borders in the way that some people here want to do is not to save people
we want to open more legal pathways
the problem however is that our current policy seems not to be working
this is together with the negotiation of the mff
we must strive to defend it and make every effort to further increase its effectiveness
for example in @ february two thousand and seventeen ] we published a staff document to explain our approach
new alliances are necessary including with big consumer countries especially % china ] and with financial institutions
finally the commission raised awareness of the importance of language learning through public events like the # european day of languages ] on @ twenty six september ] and the national awards of the european language label for innovative language learning projects
in highlighting the complexity brought about by language diversity and the fundamental importance of language technologies on the road to achieving language equality the report provides food for thought for developing future actions
and he did his job @ two years later ] @ three years later ] to see what comes out and the conclusion is clear the work was fixed the work was done
good results and even with more capacity to perform in the future
special times special situation special measures
inequality is on the rise and of course that goes precisely to those segments of the ) european ] social fabric which have been the victims of a long protracted discrimination in history the ) roma ] community of course but not only them let me say that making up the budget is not only a matter in this house for a single ) european ] political group and that of course i do favour an
the ~ second ] thing i wanted to say to you is that in the current dispensation of the ) european ] budget there is ! twenty ] for social inclusion including in the european social fund
ever since the great recession got started we ) socialists ] have fought all along the way against the recessive austerity and in favour of a ) european ] budget in order to fight social exclusion
mr president subsidiarity and proportionality seem to be the past and president } macron ] if we let him do so will change the structure the strategies and everything of the % european union ] as he
he wants a united states of europe while we ) european ] people want a * europe ] of nations of independent nations with sovereignty
we the majority of * europe ] do not want migration
on the one side there is my country % hungary ] with the ` visegrad ] countries representing clearly the majority of ) european ] citizens
the important thing is that they should speak up much more loudly
but still if we want to protect * europe ] and our countries and our communities together % hungary ] the ` visegrad ] countries and the citizens of * europe ] please speak up where ever you can and support % hungary ]
so the time really has come for the bank to adopt an up to date responsible taxation policy and that would involve ! three ] measures during the exercise of the bank 's due diligence particularly for intermediaries which as my colleague } hugues bayet ] said are a particular problem
it is that point which motivates many of the requests that have been made of the bank
it is in all of our interests for example that the fiscal capacity of member states is preserved and that the % eu ] 's aid policy is not undermined by tax leaking away from developing countries
~ firstly ] we need the bank to make use of the measures contained within the & anti money laundering directive ] and particularly to access the new registers of beneficial ownership of companies
the bank did in @ two thousand and nine ] become a pioneer when it adopted a policy against non cooperative jurisdictions but as we all know that policy has lost many of its teeth as those jurisdictions have creatively complied with the letter of ` oecd ] requirements rather than complying with their spirit
this makes them an indispensable sector in stabilising the ) european ] economy and creating jobs and growth in * europe ]
unfortunately the current instruments are insufficient and do not provide smes especially micro and small enterprises with the necessary means to finance investment
mr president for as long as i have been a member of the ` european parliament ] i have repeatedly called on the member states and the commission to join up their efforts and tackle the root causes of migration which is the only way forward in terms of providing a genuine response to the migration crisis in the % eu ] and in * africa ] the trust fund launched at the # valletta summit on migration ] is designed to help foster stability in the ) african ] regions and contribute to better migration management
most importantly the fund will help address the root causes of irregular migration by stimulating investment and boosting sustainable growth and through job creation in the ) african ] countries where most migrants come from
we have to ensure accountability transparency and proper management of funds
we have to ensure well planned investments so that the proposed ! billions ] really benefit the citizens through projects which improve education healthcare and infrastructure
of course the ` european parliament ] demands that the commission be fully transparent in all negotiations and that we be provided with timely sectoral impact assessments
i believe that this opportunity should be used by ` parliament ] to strongly support an fta with % japan ] for the following reasons the % european union ] and % japan ] are industrial giants that share democratic values and together represent
the economic benefits are clear
we share similar challenges the rise of % china ] the global financial crisis decreasing demographics and the need to access raw materials and energy sources and to achieve price stability
in addition we will support bilateral safeguard measures as was the case with the % south korea ] fta to avoid serious injury to sensitive sectors such as automotives electronics aviation and machinery
therefore i see great potential in further developing trade relations with % japan ] our ~ sixth ] largest trading partner
i would like to reiterate that non tariff barriers and public procurement are crucial areas for ) european ] businesses where % japan ] needs to make significant concessions
however unfortunately practice shows that there are always companies operating within the % eu ] that will try to circumvent the rules to gain questionable advantages
they create many jobs in * europe ] and make important investments that is true
@ more than a year ]
much of the credit for that goes to the rapporteur and the ` ecr ] will support this report in plenary
it is not just motherhood and apple pie to use the ) american ] expression but it is of some real value
there are already countries in the process whose political systems give less than full throated support to the democratic freedoms and plurality needed for an effective university sector and the admission of % belarus ] would give even more cause for concern over the confidence we want to have in the process
the legacy is repression isolation and corruption and there is an expectation of the new transition government although it is chaired by a former vice president of } mugabe ] mr } mnangagwa ]
it is probably a good thing that precisely at this time when we are reconsidering our strategic partnership with * africa ] we should get the chance to prove what we can actually mean in terms of reconstituting a democratic state in the southern part of the ) african ] continent and helping it along both democratically and economically
% zimbabwe ] has tremendous possibilities that it could use in its relationship with * europe ]
is there any other strategy
this is a disaster
it has to be solved somehow
it is not the responsibility of my country % hungary ]
we are not the ones who are going to solve it we are going to continue protecting our country and protecting the % schengen ] borders of * europe ] in accordance with our obligations
~ first ] i would like to commend your efforts to increase the overall road safety by the initiative to include new advanced safety features into cars and trucks
~ thirdly ] and finally i do regret that your proposal for a regulation on electronic freight transport information did not come a little bit earlier in the first mobility package because it could have served as a solid legal base for the enforcement part of the lex specialis on posting or for the cabotage directive
now we must make sure that they are going to be accessible to every future car owner because safety must not become a privilege of luxury car owners
but i would like to ask you mr } giegold ] what do you think will happen if countries like % sweden ] % denmark ] and % poland ] are outside the * banking union ]
mr president on behalf of my group i request that this package of reports be struck from the agenda of this session
i think that this house should show some measure of humility and some respect for the democratic process
we all know that % ireland ] has rejected the & lisbon treaty ] and so it is of some wonderment to me that this house persists in debating that matter
it is not democratically appropriate that this house should set aside the verdict of % ireland ] or that this house should be used to ratchet up pressure on % ireland ] in the coming months to adopt a treaty that is clearly not in our interests or in the interests of the ) european ] people
very often in economically difficult times young people unfortunately get into drug abuse
is it possible that the european social fund could be used in a targeted way to try and help young people considering the problems that this causes not only to themselves as individuals but to their families and to their communities and given the very severe effect it can have on communities
the % eu ] is built on the notion that we are stronger together and that fundamental rights and values must never be an issue up for compromise
however i am worried about the current developments at the same time we see attacks on independent media on lgbtqi people we see attacks on women we see attacks on migrants
i welcome of course the new rule of law report presented @ last week ] but we need to go further
this resolution suggests important measurable goals involvement of civil society and a broader scope to also include fundamental rights and democracy we must make sure that the % eu ] does not remain a toothless tiger because this report is good but we must make sure to provide it with teeth
one of the best ways of providing the tiger with teeth is through stronger conditionality linked to the budget
