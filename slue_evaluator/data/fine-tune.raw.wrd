this could be done by looking more specifically into the suggested fallback clause in & article twenty one ] in cases brought by the employee against the employer defining as relevant the place of business from which the employee receives or received day to day instructions
@ two thousand and twelve ] for instance the new & brussels i regulation ] provides for the right for employees to sue several employers together and the right for employees to have access to courts in * europe ] even if the employer is domiciled outside * europe ] the commission will
i ask you therefore to enforce the standing order and refer these reports back to committee so that they do not take up our time when they should be sorted out in committee
mr president i understood that it was a decision of the ` conference of presidents ] that any report that had more than ! fifty ] amendments had to be referred back to the committee to be resolved
we have ! four ] reports in front of us @ today ] the } langen ] } lepage ] } eickhout ] and } pieper ] reports all of which have more than ! fifty ] amendments
mr president i would just like to thank all the political groups and particularly the leaders of the political groups for a very smooth arrangement that allowed us to fill these ! two ] vacant places
the directive requires that farmers take all responsible steps to ensure that animals under their care are not caused unnecessary pain suffering or injury
the report also invites the commission to use scientific evidence as the basis for proposing new measures for housing requirements for breeding does and for rabbits reared for meat production i would remind the honourable members that all farmed animal species including rabbits are protected by the rules of & directive ninety eight ]
this priority is particularly relevant because we continue to see a widespread lack of compliance regarding animal welfare rules across many member states
this opinion provides member states and farmers with data on aspects of farming systems which may put the welfare of the rabbits at risk
as honourable members will know member states are primarily responsible for the implementation of % eu ] legislation
rabbit production in the % eu ] is essentially concentrated in a few member states mainly % italy ] % spain ] and % france ]
the rules of the directive should be seen in conjunction with this opinion
in addition in @ two thousand and five ] the ` european food safety authority ] published an opinion on the impact of the current housing and husbandry systems on the health and welfare of farmed domestic rabbits
against this background and in line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality the commission takes the view that the member states involved are better placed to address the relevant issues concerning rabbit production
! fifty eight ] concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes
in consideration of this analysis and given its limited resources the commission does not consider it appropriate to propose an initiative on the welfare of farm rabbits
the report encourages the commission to take a number of non legislative actions such as drawing up a roadmap to include guidelines on good practices and a commission recommendation relating to rabbit health welfare and housing
better enforcement of the % eu ] animal welfare legislation is ! one ] of the key priorities for animal welfare and the commission has invested substantial resources in pursuit of this aim
therefore i strongly support the report 's focus on the need to ensure implementation of existing % eu ] legislation in the member states
this stimulates growth and job creation in * europe ] and increases our energy security
furthermore an internal market for energy is an important part of the path towards more sustainable energy production that is quite obvious to us all but we should also recognise that there is a long way to go before we can realise our vision for an internal market for energy in the % eu ] ! one ] reason for this is that legislation concerning the creation of the market is delayed in many member states
today the ` european parliament ] is sending out a strong and unmistakable message to the governments in * europe ] that they must live up to their commitments in the ~ third ] energy package and we are also highlighting the importance of a more coordinated approach at % eu ] level towards national capacity mechanisms national capacity mechanisms can be necessary in some circumstances but much too often they are counterproductive as regards the aim of creating cross border markets i therefore strongly support the call to the commission to ensure a stronger and more coordinated approach capable of guaranteeing that capacity mechanisms will be transparent
before the ) european ] elections @ next year ] we can implement much of the legislation mentioned in my report
the commission will take its stand express itself and make commitments if necessary at the time of the ~ first ] reading vote
and analysing the possibility of introducing targets for separate collection or recycling of bio waste within the review of the recycling targets of the & waste framework directive ] by @ two thousand and fourteen ] at the latest
therefore the commission plans to initiate a number of actions aimed at improving bio waste management including setting criteria for the production of high quality compost using the end of waste procedure envisaged in the & waste framework directive ]
however as optimal bio waste policies may differ from country to country or even between regions further analysis on the grounds of subsidiarity is necessary
as you know on @ eighteen may ] the commission adopted the communication on future steps in bio waste management in the % european union ] this communication is accompanied by an annex with a detailed technical analysis of the measures that could be taken to improve the management of bio waste in the % eu ] as a whole and in each member state
analysing the viability of setting minimum standards for the use of bio waste in agriculture within the revision of the & sewage sludge directive ]
so it is with great regret that i have to say that i do have an argument with ! one ] part of it
the rapporteur lost my support on the point where he talks about a mandatory that means compulsory separate collection regime across * europe ]
i object to this in principle on the grounds of subsidiarity and i object most particularly on the grounds that it seeks to lock in a method that in many places is being superseded by high tech autoclave and other technology
in other words it is becoming outmoded before we have even set it up and this really puts % eu ] regulation in its worst possible light
i object to the knee jerk reaction to call for more regulation rather than create incentives and i urge the commission to maintain its position and oppose the call for compulsion
in addition in terms of success in helping the development and the placing on the market of medicines for rare and life threatening diseases the commission has already authorised ! one hundred and six ] of such innovative treatments
this commitment was highlighted in the commission 's communication of @ april this year ] on effective and resilient health systems which among other things focused on increasing accessibility to health systems
the commission is therefore looking forward to the debate planned by the ) italian ] presidency on therapeutic innovation at @ next week ] 's informal # council of health ministers ] the outcome of this debate will help inform the new commission about the interest of member states in continuing an % eu ] debate on the affordability of innovative health products
these are determined by member states individually
however the commission can offer help for example by pursuing improved exchanges of information among member states on their pricing policies with a view to minimising negative effects on the accessibility of medicines in the % eu ]
the commission has however no competence to regulate the level of prices of medicinal treatments
of course the discussion on the impact of prices on the affordability of medicines for public payers and patients goes far beyond the specific case of hepatitis c treatments
thus there can be no price caps imposed by the commission
as regards support to research and development the commission is hopeful that the ongoing innovative medicines initiative will help speed up the development of better and safer medicines
% eu ] pharmaceutical legislation contains a number of tools to facilitate early access to medicines for patients with unmet medical needs
the communication stressed the need for improved cooperation increased transparency and better coordination to minimise any unintended effects that current national pricing systems may have in terms of accessibility throughout the % eu ]
another way in which the commission could assist would be by further exploring the use of the joint procurement mechanism to obtain more advantageous price offers from the pharmaceutical industry
lastly i want to add my voice to the long list of organisations including the ) european ] consumer organisation ` age platform ] and the ` standing committee of european doctors ] asking commissioner } juncker ] to revisit his decision to move medicinal products and health technologies into the portfolio of the commissioner for the internal market
the commission itself in its country specific recommendations tells us that limitations on access to healthcare may weigh disproportionately on the more vulnerable sections of society the people who rely disproportionately on public services in my own country % ireland ] the cuts in health expenditure @ between two thousand and nine and two thousand and eleven ] were of the order of ! seventeen ]
they are caused by supply issues they are caused by production issues and most certainly they are caused by affordability issues
he will also have people from his team who are listening to this debate and taking notes
there are other things for instance the exchange of information
there are other things and as far as i understand it the informal ` health council ] will actually have this on their agenda at their next meeting
thank you very much for the input
the ~ third ] point and the key point i would like to underline is and maybe i am just an observer getting it wrong but it seems to me while the ` african union ] does play a role we see that the mediators mission has been postponed and honestly i would have expected the ` african union ] to be much more vocal and much more engaged
sometimes we forget it
sometimes we focus on our own limits or divisions and for sure we have both limits and divisions but when we look at the work the % european union ] does from the outside with the eyes of the citizens of % gabon ] who were welcoming our mission we recognise how relevant our work is how important our values are how powerful our instruments are and how much expectation as well
this is really a key part of our common work that i appreciate very much
we will look at what is happening and follow and monitor the situation in these critical hours and days extremely carefully and i know that you will do the same
the % eu ] is ready to contribute to this process no electoral process is completed without transparent post electoral mechanisms transparency is one of the fundamental principles of free fair and competitive elections and must also be ensured in the days after the election day in the case of % gabon ] this needed to be ensured by publishing the results of the voting stations and by a transparent appeal process this also applies to the current complaint procedures at the constitutional court i am sure that our observation mission
the commission believes that the text has reached an excellent balance
but that was difficult to achieve in practice
defending the effectiveness of competition authorities is good news for the victims of anti trust infringements
consumers and small companies especially have found it difficult to obtain compensation for the harm they suffered
! one ] way to do this is by allowing victims to use the infringement decisions of competition authorities in their own claims in parallel the directive also clarifies the relationship between public and private enforcement of % eu ] competition laws in particular when it comes to accessing documents that are in the possession of a competition authority
the directive includes rules that remove the current obstacles
i would like to underline the importance of the directive
when vice president } almunia ] was before you in his hearing @ four years ago ] he promised that ` parliament ] would be fully involved in this file as co legislator as a consequence @ today ] we bring this file negotiated under the ordinary legislative procedure to a successful end
we especially welcome that we can adopt this today at the very last moment before you all go campaigning
it has been described by the press as the most important development in competition policy of the last years and as a democratisation of the competition law enforcement
the text that you will be voting @ tomorrow ] preserves a company 's incentives to cooperate with competition authorities through leniency programmes and settlement procedures
it gives victims better access to the evidence they need to prove their claims and it ensures that victims can overcome the burden of providing a competition law infringement
the more decisions are taken the easier it will be for the victims to claim damages
it enables citizens and businesses harmed by anti trust infringements to effectively exercise the right to compensation that the % eu ] is granting them
@ in recent years ] we have seen very few actions and many of them have failed because of inadequate legal frameworks
on the ! one ] hand it will be easier for victims to exercise the right to compensation
@ more than ten years ago ] the ` court of justice ] first recognised that any victim of anti trust infringement had a right to compensation
large companies smes and consumers will be able to effectively claim full compensation before national courts throughout the % union ] for the harm they have suffered
in addition the right of compensation will apply to the victims who have actually suffered the harm including those who had no direct dealings with an infringer because they were further down the supply chain
i want to stress that we are indeed talking about full and fair compensation
we all agree that multiple compensation for the same harm should be avoided and the directive includes provision to achieve this goal at the same time the text regulates interaction between the public and private enforcement of competition law leading to an optimal overall enforcement of competition rules
the effectiveness of essential tools of public enforcement such as leniency programmes is maintained and even enhanced while respecting % eu ] rules on transparency as well as the fundamental rights of the victims
the other continents are surging ahead but the * eurozone ] economy is the same size that it was in
are represented by ! one twenty eighth ] of an % eu ] official i think at the moment a ) swedish ] former sociology professor
we have to make our way in the world through what we buy and sell that means we have to be where the customers are
free trade makes conflict both pointless and unduly hurtful to the perpetrator
the customers are not in * europe ] and we need to leave the % european union ] and take back our place in the ` wto ]
that is not just a problem in theory it is very much a problem in practice when we think that * europe ] is the only continent on the planet not experiencing economic growth
yet and this point is still not widely understood despite more than @ forty years ] of membership of the % european union ] the % uk ] does not have a separate voice or vote in the ` world trade organization ] we
free trade is particularly in the interests of small and medium firms and of consumers in a country like % ecuador ]
they can go further when they think the % eu ] is being unduly protectionist
it is also and we always seem to forget this point mentioned as one of the primary objectives of the % european union ] in the & treaty of rome ]
application and oversight etc
they will have a field day here because there is so much simplification needed
of course people feel strongly about it it touches us emotionally and it opens the door to what has come to be known as virtue signalling people using a legislative or political issue as an opportunity to broadcast to the world what very nice people they are
but stand back and ask the question is it right for sensitive issues moral issues one might say of this nature to be dealt with at a continental level
is it not precisely matters of this kind in which opinions run so strongly among our constituents that ought to be determined through our national democratic mechanisms and procedures
unfortunately our governments in the past have not listened to } thomas jefferson ] 's words and we have become entangled with the % european union ] thus losing our spot in the ` world trade organization ]
as a consequence we cannot influence properly the world trade liberalisation programme
we cannot influence tariff reductions that would benefit the people of the % united kingdom ]
but more importantly than that they cursed my country and they oppress their own people
@ two thousand and nine ] this decision had been preceded by a discussion with member states in the ` council ]
the government of % nicaragua ] has announced that the next regional elections in @ two thousand and ten ] and the general election in @ two thousand and eleven ] will have national and international observation teams
this represents a small part of the funds that have been suspended which amount to an additional ( eur forty six million ]
the government has also committed inter alia to improving its civil registry and electoral role with the support of an ec project and to appoint credible and professional electoral authorities @ next year ]
at the same time the % eu ] is trying to maintain a balance with our long standing commitment to support the development and stability of this developing country and the * central american ] region more generally
without going into the details of this i think it is very important that when we take that kind of decision we have a kind of a procedure whereby we at least try to make sure that the ` european commission ] and the member states are taking the same line with respect to
there was criticism @ last week ] in the ` development council ] that there were no previous discussions on this with the member states
following numerous contacts with the ) nicaraguan ] authorities which gave credible commitments that corrective steps would be taken the commission proceeded at the @ beginning of october ] with a single payment of ( eur ten million ] of our budget support programme to the education sector
on the other hand recent developments such as the ruling by the ` constitutional chamber ] certainly cast a shadow on the seriousness of the ) nicaraguan ] government to live up to its commitments
mr president honourable colleagues as you know the % european union ] is engaged in a difficult dialogue with this country aimed at preserving democracy and restoring its citizens trust in the country 's democratic institutions
at the end of the day implementation of these commitments will be crucial for the progressive resumption of our budgetary support programmes
i do not understand why it is not urgent to take the floor discussing the issue of the treatment of one of the members of this ` parliament ] who has visited a country exercising his right as president of ` liberal international ]
i do not understand why we cannot take the floor and speak about this issue and also speak about this new tendency in * latin america ] to try to change arbitrarily the constitution of the country and stop a tradition that has always existed concerning ! one ] or ! two ] terms of office of the head of state in that country
these presidents with extended powers have not been able or willing to improve the quality of life of their subjects
in % nicaragua ] we can see a warning example that such kinds of rulers do not change they return to power only to misuse it once again
mr president % nicaragua ] remains ! one ] of the poorest countries in the * americas ] the fact that president } daniel ortega ] has failed to improve his country 's situation despite myriad ) socialist ] utopian promises upon taking office would suggest that % nicaragua ] needs a change of leadership now
the country 's constitution permits heads of state to serve only ! one ] term sometimes a wise policy in a region prone to instability but } ortega ] is once again showing his contempt for parliamentary democracy and the rule of law by abusing the constitutional court 's powers
both men have made their names denouncing caudillos but they themselves are turning into caudillos of the left and as such represent a genuine threat to regional democratic stability especially given the chaos in nearby % honduras ]
these evaluations are ongoing so it is too early to assess the state of play of the preparations
member states of course shall be involved to maintain mutual trust among each other on their capacity to apply all accompanying measures allowing for the lifting of internal border control in particular in the field of external borders visa and police cooperation the ` european parliament ] should indeed be fully informed of the outcome of these results of the evaluation
on that basis and under current legislation it is up to the ` council ] to inform ` parliament ] accordingly in this context i would like to take up your proposal and confirm that i will soon in @ the autumn ] propose a new evaluation mechanism following the entry into force of the & lisbon treaty ] for the reasons that you stated mr } coelho ]
there is no real follow up at this time after evaluations are made and the recommendations are not always implemented
i think that both member states and ` parliament ] should be involved in this mechanism
with this new mechanism the commission aims to remedy the current weaknesses as referred to by the rapporteur
but the ~ first ] steps have been successful confirmed by the positive evaluation of data protection which allows now % bulgaria ] and % romania ] to get access to the schengen information system
it is indeed the practice in the current & schengen ] evaluation that the member states concerned report to the ` council ] on the measures to comply with the recommendations as the evaluation mechanism is now under full responsibility of the ` council ]
the security of travel without border controls rests heavily upon trust in the ability of individual member states to perform checks to appropriate standards
spyware allows a ~ third ] party to access the same data as the user
will we have to provide financial support for developing information gathering systems in those countries aspiring to * schengen ] in order to mitigate the potential increase in crime related to open border policy
in particular the equilibrium between cost and efficiency
member states must demonstrate exceptionally advanced security and even with the greatest efforts and intentions one cannot rule out the possibility of a breach which in turn would compromise all involved
for example at what point will the storage of biometric data be positive
the broader the system the more data there is to access and the greater the number of criminals with aspirations to abuse the system
similarly deeper integration alongside a broadening of member state involvement may require an expansion of measures used in the schengen information system especially as we approach the advent of sis ii
the % uk ] operates independent stringent checks and does not participate in passport free travel
after the accession of % bulgaria ] and % romania ] to the sis the primary question must be whether these member states are at a point where they can guarantee a level of scrutiny domestically to warrant free movement across the continent there has been significant opposition to moving towards a ~ second ] evolution of the schengen information system
& schengen ] brought with it an increase in the possibility of trafficking in illegal goods and people across borders
the expansion of the schengen information system increases the window for corruption and creates a much larger collection of information for criminals wishing to hack into the network
it cannot be known how many of these systems are free of malicious software in general ! one ] in ! two ] computers have been victims to malicious infection
critics also worry that the system may be used to monitor citizens with particular political views with information garnered liable to be mishandled for political ends with an increasing number of states joining the acquis the risk is heightened
the * schengen area ] is an achievement of the % european union ] we can be extremely proud of it
the % uk ] has been a net beneficiary of the former fp seven programme and i very much hope that this will continue to be the case during the lifetime of horizon
@ two thousand and twenty ] % london ] my constituency is home to many leading internationally known universities and it is these institutions which need this continued successful funding
for these reasons i fully endorse the necessity of integrating the principle of special and differential treatment throughout the process and increasing its precision and efficiency and reiterating support for the everything but arms initiative
mr president although the @ twelve years ] of the % doha ] trade talks have been marked by the repeated collapse of negotiations and allegations of bad faith the development agenda is still the best current hope we have in promoting multilateral free and fair trade across the world and in reducing the many non tariff barriers placed in its path we in the % eu ] the world 's most successful trading bloc know how the abolition of tariffs and quotas can increase prosperity for all but we also know that this cannot be achieved without extremely careful deliberation and clearly targeted reforms which take into account the needs of all countries and not simply the richest
i am also pleased that as part of the process the ` ecr ] my group has been able to enforce its message of encouraging a reduction in bureaucracy and bringing results to our wider campaign to cut burdensome and unnecessary red tape
mr president in concluding the } creutzmann ] report the % eu ] has been able to provide an improved programme to replace the previous competiveness and innovation framework
indeed this aim will provide ! one ] of the ! five ] fundamental indicators for the achievement of the programme 's objectives
given that funding for university and public research centres is a lifeline at a time of economic crisis it is unfair that large companies will now receive a larger slice of the funding furthermore i would have preferred to see a much more explicit mention of the new % eu ] guidelines for preventing funding going to ) israeli ] companies with activities in the occupied territories of % palestine ]
since the foundation of the state that this neutrality would be recognised and respected and that there would be no effort to coerce us to be part of anything greater
neutrality has served us well particularly in relation to being able to send peace missions through our defence forces across the world where they have had great acceptability because we were a neutral country
that point should not be lost having said that we recognise the subsidiarity rules
this is vital for small theatres across * europe ]
madam president i am moving this oral amendment so that ` parliament ] has the opportunity to express its support for the current exemption for stage lighting from the ecodesign regulations
and yes of course we have to deal with the root causes but let us accept that our own failure in being able to help do so means that we have an obligation to help
some children are dying of hypothermia as a result of inadequate winter shelter
mr president if the international community has not the political will to address the root causes of the conflict in % palestine ] namely the occupation of % palestine ] the blockade of % gaza ] % israel ] 's ongoing violation of international and humanitarian law if indeed the collective political will is not there to resolve this mess
fine words yet some meps act as spectators too or worse defenders of unacceptable breaches of such international and humanitarian law
so let us give them the funding that they need to help the ) palestinian ] refugees
so far ` unrwa ] has received ! one hundred and thirty five million ] leaving a shortfall of ( usd five hundred and eighty five million ]
! ninety six thousand ] ) palestinian ] homes were destroyed or damaged during the last onslaught on % gaza ]
in the overpopulated open prison of * gaza ] people are sleeping among the rubble
then at the very least we should stop taking it out on the most vulnerable people in % gaza ] @ for months ] in this chamber i have heard mep after mep defending human rights and international law
there is ! one ] indisputable fact when ) palestinians ] are silent they are forgotten by many but thankfully not by ` unrwa ] whose ! twelve five hundred ] staff work tirelessly on all our behalf
the aim of our support to the agency 's regular budget is to sustain the delivery of essential public services to the refugees
allow me to recall that along with its member states the % european union ] remains the largest and most predictable donor to the agency
in combination with contributions from % eu ] member states the overall contribution in @ two thousand and fourteen ] accounted for ! thirty four ] of the total support to ` unrwa ] let me also stress that the % european union ] has always been very quick
i am particularly impressed by how the agency has been performing under increasingly difficult circumstances in particular in % gaza ] during and after the recent war as well as in % syria ] with severe consequences in % lebanon ] and % jordan ]
@ two thousand and fourteen ] this additional allocation has allowed the agency ~ firstly ] to support children returning to school after the conflict and to provide basic food to over ! eight hundred ] ! zero ] refugees ( eur seven million ] from the ) european ] neighbourhood instrument has been provided for that
the % european union ] strongly calls on all donors to fulfil the pledges announced at the # cairo conference ] on % gaza ] reconstruction in order to meet the immediate needs of the most vulnerable households in % gaza ]
this money will cover cash assistance for improving shelter conditions for the most vulnerable households and providing household items which were lost during @ last year ] 's hostilities
once again thank you for your political backing by adopting tomorrow a strong resolution on this issue and i can once again reassure you that we will also take this into account in other areas in our relations and negotiations with % norway ] in the future
according to figures for the @ first five months of two thousand and thirteen ] the export of cheese from the % eu ] to % norway ] has actually increased by
we are considering what can be done bilaterally and will also take this into account in other areas of our relations with % norway ]
we consider that the measures taken by % norway ] are protectionist in nature and are not the type of action one would expect from our friends and neighbours
they went on to say that in @ two thousand and fourteen ] they would hold a review of the conditions of trade with a view to exploring further possible concessions that was an agreement commissioner and both parties agreed at the time which was mutually beneficial
i would urge and encourage the commission to take action to curb these duties before a formal review takes place in
the facts are @ today ] that trade in agricultural products makes up a mere
@ two thousand and twelve ] in that agreement both parties committed to continue in the spirit of & article nineteen of the eea ] agreement i remind you that under that agreement both parties committed to continue efforts to achieving progressive liberalisation of agricultural trade
it is also incomprehensible that a country that avoided the negative effects of the economic crisis would want to introduce such measures
this is unacceptable since % norway ] is a country with which the % eu ] has very close economic and political relations
by focusing on ! fifty ] ! zero ] of the most vulnerable children helping through education and vocational training and equipping them with skills which can lift them out of poverty it is hoped that this will help keep those children safe from trafficking
! one ] ! two million ] people are trafficked every year globally and it is estimated that ! twenty seven ] to ! thirty five million ] people worldwide are trapped in a life of slavery
in conclusion a child is trafficked every > thirty seconds ]
human trafficking is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world
well tell that to ! two hundred and twenty ] of my constituents who lost their jobs when $ tilbury power station ] closed in
in @ may ] you will be judged by your actions because ` ukip ] is standing up for working people in the % united kingdom ]
madam president in order to force the ) irish ] people to pay ! forty three ] of the ) european ] banking crisis % dublin ] governments have introduced several new stealth charges and taxes that have caused devastation and hardship to many families
that under pressure the ) irish ] government has now introduced temporary caps proves that the charge has absolutely nothing to do with water conservation but is just another attack on ) irish ] families
they have been unfair and have deliberately targeted those on lower incomes disproportionately
the ) irish ] people are sending a very clear message that they have had enough
the ) irish ] government has called it a water charge but the ) irish ] people see it for what it is another tax which if introduced would put many families over the edge and would further hamper domestic economies
the shocking reports that a ! thousand ] ) rohingya ] boat people over a @ twelve day ] period who instead of being brought to safety by the ) thai ] authorities who discovered them were instead towed into international waters without navigational equipment food and water and left to fend for themselves sickens anyone with an iota of human decency
% thailand ] must also take responsibility
the problems of abuse at the hands of ) thai ] officials must be seriously addressed
many of these people are sold as slaves the women and children are forced into sexual slavery and the men are sold as forced labour onto fishing vessels some of this fish may even enter the % eu ] market
the ) thai ] prime minister must act
it is no wonder that many attempt to leave % burma ] as they have no other option
only @ yesterday ] an article in ` the guardian ] highlighted other incidents the latest case involved ! two hundred and twenty ] men who were discovered in an open craft by fishermen these refugees claimed they were detained by ) thai ] authorities on a remote island @ for two months ] and that they were beaten before being forced onto boats and left to their fate the abuse and lack of international coordinated action to help the ) rohingya ] must be addressed
as an ethnic minority the ) rohingya ] people are systematically denied civil rights that most of the rest of the world take for granted the right to marry the right to move freely the right to citizenship of the country they live in and the right to a proper education
we in this house are well aware of the plight of the people of % burma ] generally but since the riots by ) buddhist ] monks of @ two thousand and seven ] that country has rather faded somewhat from the public consciousness
in contrast we can expect very little from the brutal ) burmese ] military leaders impervious as they have been to our many pleas @ for years ]
the ) rohingya ] people have suffered double discrimination @ for years ]
the brutality of the military junta stands in stark contrast to the action of % thailand ] which has only partially in my view discharged its responsibility for the ) rohingya ] refugees as it unfortunately alleges that most of them are purely economic refugees which i believe to be highly unlikely and tried sending them back
the appalling fate of the little known about ) rohingya ] people especially those fleeing by boat as refugees that are the subject of this resolution has renewed our attention on the despotic regime in % burma ] a country so rich in human potential otherwise
as ) muslims ] they are being denied the right to practise their faith freely a right that we in the % eu ] recognise as fundamental and their mosques have been damaged and desecrated
in praising our own progressive achievements in the field of human rights we in the % eu ] can tend to lose sight of the fact that many people in the world lack even these basic entitlements
the commission welcomes the government 's intention to allow the office of the un high commissioner for refugees access to the boat people
more than ! one million ] % myanmar ] citizens constitute an important part of the workforce in % thailand ] in the agricultural sector in textiles and in the tourism sector the ) rohingya ] boat people trapped in % thailand ] are part of the multi faceted
political humanitarian economic and social solution
recent political uncertainties in % thailand ] interrupted the dialogue with the government on this issue but that is temporary
in conclusion a sustainable solution cannot be the result of short term security considerations but must take into account long term humanitarian political and socio economic concerns
the commission encourages the ) thai ] government to seek regional cooperation involving also the ) un ] high commissioner for refugees as the ) rohingya ] issue and the other displacement issues mentioned earlier need a comprehensive response
thus the commission expects that the % eu ] 's initiative vis vis the government will result in a constructive approach
the commission is conducting an intensive debate with the international community and the ) thai ] government in a search for possible solutions
forced or voluntary emigration from % myanmar ] moreover % thailand ] has other refugee issues to settle as well such as the ) hmong ] people from % laos ] the complexity of these issues requires a comprehensive
it welcomed the ) thai ] government 's intention to investigate the incidents fully and to share its findings and urged the ) thai ] government to treat boat people arriving in ) thai ] waters according to international humanitarian and human rights standards
for % thailand ] the survivors accounts are damning to say the least
the prime minister to his credit has promised a full investigation but we need to support him in acting independently of his army and following the international norms of human behaviour
women ought to be adequately represented in all political economic and social bodies in the agriculture sector so that decision making processes are informed by both male and female perspectives
i welcome paragraph ! four ] about the importance of an adequate budget for agriculture in general and paragraph ! ten ] about new technologies in rural areas and the need to widen the access to broadband
it is a compliment to her work that there are no amendments tabled to this important report
i would ask you to bring that message to the commission
i worry that some farmers are trying to second guess the outcome of those reforms and that they may be taking on additional costs which will be a burden to them
not many people realise that ! forty two ] of those engaged regularly in agriculture are women and that ! three ] out of every ! ten ] holdings in the % eu ] are managed by women
these services should include such things as healthcare and care services education leisure transport and broadband it is crucial that all services are not just market oriented
it is also important for women 's entrepreneurial skills to be facilitated and across the board for women to be involved in decision making at local and regional level in farm organisations and indeed in all decision making bodies
in order for women and families to remain in the countryside and make their contribution to achieving the objectives of the eu two thousand and twenty strategy through agriculture there must be a range of services and facilities for normal everyday life
there also needs to be proper social insurance for women working in agriculture so that their future and their pensions can be guaranteed
the rural development regulation provides for support in a number of areas which are important for women in rural areas
the setting up and development of micro enterprises adding value to agricultural projects and seeking sales outlets for them are only a few examples
the rural development policy also foresees possibilities to help men and women to balance family and professional life for example under the basic services measure social facilities like day care centres for children or elderly people can be supported in addition local transport services and small scale infrastructure are eligible for support the situation in rural areas is very diverse across member states including
as regards possibilities and requirements for women
member states and regions have to carefully analyse the situation and design tailor made measures linked to local conditions taking account of the specific problems women face
in addition member states can use financial engineering to set up guarantee funds in order to help women to get access to credit
women should also play an important role in the leader programme where they should bring in their specific interests and their specific potential in order to mobilise the development potential of an area
the commission agrees that it would be useful to have more data on the situation of women
however especially in the light of member states call for simplification it would prove difficult to convince them of additional reporting burdens but for those data for which it is possible statistics should be presented and analysed broken down by gender
the commission will include where available data on women in its progress report on the implementation of the strategic guidelines for rural development ! one ] very important factor in taking women forward in agriculture and rural areas is the exchange of experience
in this context i would like to draw your attention to the ` european network for rural development ] and its constituent national networks
they can be used to learn from each other 's best practices and it would be desirable if more women 's associations made use of these existing networks in order to connect women in different rural areas with each other
it is clear that * europe ] has to act to tackle the disappearance of migrant children with every possible means and as soon as possible i believe the commission should inform us when it is going to present a comprehensive strategy to protect all children in migration as announced @ last may ] in the & european agenda on migration ] and how it
the * eu schengen area ] and open borders policy has helped to create an immigration and asylum racket get the children in ~ first ] and then the families can follow
in @ two thousand and fifteen ] ! eighty five four hundred and eighty two ] unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in the % eu ] which was ! three ] times the @ two thousand and fourteen ] figure
are we to believe these children were sent abroad unaccompanied
are we to believe that in @ a single year ] ! eighty five ] ! zero ] minors made their own decision to make their way to * europe ] entirely on their own
now it seems that ! thousands ] of these children have gone missing their fate unknown
they were trafficked by criminal gangs but someone had to pay the gang ~ first ] and presumably that was their parents or families
mr president the ` united nations refugee agency ] estimates that ! thirty five ] of migrants entering the % european union ] since @ january two thousand and sixteen ] were children
so we really do need to make our system start working
it is no surprise that kids will believe smugglers promises to reunite them with family when we see the reality of what many of those minors currently face and the lack of information they get we only have to look at the scandal of % calais ] in terms of child protection children identified there by civil society organisations
we know that we need governments to step up and indeed to step in to help those countries under particular pressure
so i think we need to think seriously about how we improve that but we do need as others have said a system that works in reality
not the authorities a supreme court judgment to remind the ) british ] government of their obligations a totally inadequate system of cooperation and transfer between % france ] and the % uk ] and still poor delivery even now the ) french ] are closing the centres that they took unaccompanied minors to and the ) british ] government thinks it has done its job although there are still at least ! one ] ! zero ] who have potentially the legal right to be there under & dublin ]
the schengen information system constitutes the only * europe ] wide information exchange on missing persons in general
it is our duty to protect children we need to focus on prevention the quality of care and protection we must reinforce our fight against the criminals mobilise and inform public opinion and put pressure on member
additional funding is also available under the rights equality and citizenship programme to improve child protection in migration
they offer capacity building activities and collaborate with public security departments for investigations on smuggling and trafficking
for instance we suggest having a new type of preventive alert for missing unaccompanied children to be issued in cases when a child is particularly at risk better use must also be made of the existing missing children hotline
in % greece ] the commission is actively supporting the appointment of a child protection officer in each hotspot
if children go missing they have to be found and they have to be found fast
children in migration need to be protected assisted and offered durable solutions at all stages of migration
this challenge is becoming even more pressing given that in @ two thousand and sixteen ] children represented ! twenty six ] of the arrivals by sea
the commission is working on concrete and comprehensive actions to ensure the protection of children in migration
the migration crisis has been exploited by ruthless criminal networks involved in trafficking in human beings to target the most vulnerable in particular women and children
for this system to be useful missing children must be reported to the police and other relevant responsible authorities
it is a question of political will we are dealing with human beings and the most vulnerable of human beings children we should not be lecturing other countries about human rights whilst we let this happen on our own continent beyond the issues of relocation and procedure we must have put in place mechanisms to support and heal children who very often experience immense suffering and trauma often resulting in serious mental health issues this must be done by taking into account the special needs of children with disabilities and young women and girls and we must also give these children access to education
it is not a question of money
i can assure you that the commission is working on concrete and comprehensive actions to protect children in migration and offer them a future
@ tomorrow ] the commission will adopt a package of reports that show that all actions are interlinked
eligible in % greece ] and in % italy ] should be relocated @ before september ]
let me stress that the ) european ] legislation requires member states to place minor migrants only in specialised detention centres that are adapted for migrants so that they have access to leisure activities
sometimes as i said before this is for their own protection because let us be clear the reality out there on the ground is not ideal
it is happening @ today ] in * europe ] we are far away from a zero tolerance policy against traffickers and smugglers with the ` intergroup on children 's rights ] in this ` parliament ] together with ` missing children europe ] we have been at the forefront in putting this emergency at the top of the % eu ] agenda
we call on the police to prioritise missing children without double standards between ) european ] and migrant children we need effective rules for cross border cooperation and increased cooperation with ` europol ] filling the existing gaps
we need to allocate more resources to hotlines to help report disappearances and build trust with migrant children to prevent them from running away to make sure children remain in the protection system and to provide them with a safe environment and decent living standards children must be registered when entering the % european union ] and i support the commissioner 's
* europe ] should mean safety for them
it will not be acceptable if it is perceived to be in the interests of ! one ] ! two ] ! three ] ! four ] or ! five ] economically powerful states
but we must convince the people of * europe ] that it is necessary and the way we will do that is by ensuring that it is legitimate
we already have a richer tapestry of ideas in our amendments to the economic governance package so we will have little difficulty in moving into codecision to merge the outcomes of the positions that we take in ` parliament ] and ` council ]
i commend the president of the ` ecb ] because he has paid heed to the discussions and reports in the ` parliament ] and recognises our direction and determination
to the ) german ] people convulsed with the transfer union issue i say look at what accompanies the demands of your own government recapitalisation of banks and purchase of sovereign debt in a ~ secondary ] market
% germany ] 's banks will not meet new international rules for bank capital so transfer to ) german ] banks should also be the issue on your lips
% germany ] 's banks will take @ ten years ] to recognise their impaired assets from the crisis and that includes sovereign debt
madam president every week the press is filled with news of a new or modified proposal from a country the ` european council ] and the president of the commission
it is about the external competitiveness that a large single market can generate so it is intimately mixed with the recovery side of economic governance we also need a permanent financial stability mechanism capable of evolving over time subject to governance and priorities
but we should not cherry pick from the single market nor continue to get it wrong
what is the treaty basis for this exclusion
the single market includes ! twenty seven ] member states as does the challenge of competitiveness
why not apply treaty based enhanced cooperation within the treaties with a central role for the ` european commission ]
it was ironic because his next sentence was and that is why in * europe ] facing the euro crisis we must reinforce the community method
he may vote for it but the peoples of * europe ] have not voted for it
i know the ` european parliament ] voted for you but you were the only candidate that was offered to us
we cannot go on as a % european union ] buying our own debt
if we do the next debt crisis will not be in a country but will be a debt crisis of the ` european central bank ] itself
nobody has voted for that
he talked about the events in % egypt ] and elsewhere saying that it is wonderful that people are rising up seeking democracy
i would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then if you do not like what they do you can get rid of them turf them out and put somebody else in
nobody has been asked whether they want it
for the public watching in on this which increasingly they do the community method means that laws are proposed in secret by unelected bureaucrats people like you mr } barroso ]
could i ask him what is the basis of the % united kingdom ]
is this not a union of nations
the { twelve and half per cent ] corporate rate is critical to supporting our economic recovery retaining our jobs and employment growth
as a result of establishing a low corporate tax rate ! eight ] of the world 's top technology firms are based in my country
any move towards converging or harmonising the rate of company tax in the % european union ] would substantially damage % ireland ] 's ability to attract foreign direct investment and hence our ability to grow to economic recovery it is important to remember that % ireland ] like indeed other smaller countries
madam president in a crisis one sometimes has to act quickly and it is clear that the * eurozone ] is not out of its crisis but one also has to act intelligently the % uk ] restored market confidence by reforms to control spending and reduce national debt
` parliament ] 's procedures do not allow it to make rapid decisions but there are suggestions tabled by meps that perhaps the ` european council ] could find helpful
on the ) irish ] interest rate those of us who have lent another country money deserve an interest rate which reflects the risk but we also want our money back
i have suggested a pre payment incentive a bonus to reward early repayment
under the economic governance package member states will have to be more transparent with their own budgets
i would suggest the same thing should happen for taxpayers contributing to the % eu ] 's budget
i hope that despite this crisis our national governments will be able to listen to suggestions from this house and work together in a constructive manner
we are now calling on the incoming ) irish ] presidency to deal with this issue in a pragmatic and realistic manner
` parliament ] is experiencing with the ` council ] on the issue of long term management plans
so no progress has been made
these plans are vitally important in terms of protecting fishing resources and ensuring the livelihoods of communities depending on fishing
it is a senseless interpretation
i want to stress that the commission must take this audit and the recommendations of my report into account when preparing the next programming period
thank you very much for your support for the report
the dispute with the ` council ] must be resolved
now should % turkey ] obtain freedom of movement what is your careful estimate of the number of ) turkish ] citizens who will emigrate from % turkey ] to northern * europe ] in particular to % germany ] and the % uk ]
there is no shortcut which would ignore this value based accession process where conditionality is our main instrument what i have always expected from this house is that
many of you have referred to
way to become a % european union ] member state to deliver fully on all chapters of the accession process there is no derogation from the fundamental freedoms rule of law accountability
there are no interim periods
i hope that the ) greek ] presidency of the ` council ] could be more helpful in this particular area
it is very much in our interest to do all we can to ensure that % turkey ] continues as a stable increasingly prosperous free market secular democracy firmly oriented to the * west ] and a strong ` nato ] ally
how much easier for our own citizens to accept % turkey ] if the free movement issue is properly addressed including with a long transition period
in particular we want to get away from the obsession with political integration
they are concerned about free movement as an unqualified right and in these dangerous and unstable times they prefer the guarantee of ` nato ] rather than the theatricals of % eu ] defence policy
can i say ~ first ] of all that many of us want to see major changes in the nature of the % european union ] itself
instead our citizens want to focus on economic growth and improved international competitiveness
it is in this context that we should view our relationship with % turkey ]
on this basis let us send positive signals to % turkey ] open the energy chapter give fresh vitality to negotiations provide increased humanitarian assistance to the refugees in % turkey ] 's border areas and encourage the talks on the reunification of % cyprus ] recognising that this is a genuinely ! two ] sided issue which would be helped by substantive confidence building measures from both ) greeks ] and ) turks ]
more than ! fifty ] public sector workers were arrested @ last month ] simply for their membership of the ` kesk ] public sector trade union with the ` international trade union confederation ] i condemn the misuse of anti terrorist laws in this matter
i join others in sharing my deep concern about proposals to block access to ` youtube ] and ` facebook ] which represent a serious threat to freedom of expression in the country
this is what % turkey ] itself asked for so let us take their word for it and let us engage in a constructive dialogue to deliver results on these crucial issues
unfortunately as i said there have also been reasons for serious concern
this is the only way for the % european union ] to remain an anchor of reforms in % turkey ] and to support all those in that country who call for more freedom and democracy
goes into the right direction we need for instance to work more closely together before legislation is envisaged and drafted
on the positive side we have opened the accession negotiations on the regional policy chapter the ~ first ] chapter opened in more than @ three years ] we have signed the readmission agreement and launched the visa liberalisation dialogue
such a special country for the % european union ]
@ over the past year ] there have been positive developments but also reasons for serious concern
the accession process is certainly the central one but others are growing in significance notably our dialogue and cooperation on foreign policy our trade relations our cooperation on mobility and migration and our dialogue on energy issues these are other aspects that make % turkey ]
we have also launched the evaluation of the ` customs union ] to assess its strengths and weaknesses in order to benefit more from our longstanding trade relations
these relate ~ first ] and foremost to the government 's response to the recent corruption allegations in particular the adoption of legislation which affects the functioning of the judiciary and freedom of expression
we will report extensively on these developments also in our forthcoming progress report in @ october ] i intend to continue and even deepen a resolute patient and frank engagement with % turkey ] on the rule of law and fundamental freedoms but in addition we need to change the way we cooperate in order to ensure that development in the different policy areas
the commission will approach our ) turkish ] counterparts on this basis in the @ coming weeks ] to ensure that we have a common understanding on the principles of our cooperation
in the meantime i will continue to urge the council to formulate at last a roadmap or if you would prefer opening benchmarks for chapter ! twenty three ] of the accession negotiations
% turkey ] should be regarded as too big too poor too different and too authoritarian ever to become a member of the % european union ]
there is like in % cuba ] a bill to curb internet freedom
they are clearly not paying any attention to the commissioner at all
worst of all currently there are ! forty ] journalists in prison in % turkey ]
the commissioner in his arrogant self absorption said that he had spoken to the ) turks ] about this
the justice minister has powers to appoint and discipline judges and prosecutors
in % turkey ] there is a subjugation of the media the judiciary and civil society that is almost without precedent in a seeming democracy to put it simply % turkey ] does not subscribe to * western ] values
it is totally depressing that the establishment ) uk ] political parties are all cheerleaders for % turkey ] to join the % eu ]
we welcome of course the release of journalists and others who have been detained @ for years ] but those who are suspected of murdering members of the ` council of state ] and ) christian ] missionaries are also being released this is just ! one ] example friends and foes keep changing
it is unclear what to believe any more the truth seems to shift according to which newspaper one reads
the people of % turkey ] to a great extent are losing their belief in the rule of law and democracy which are the core values of the % eu ]
but instead of being strong and clear on human rights we have been starting to export our own human rights problems into % turkey ] as we are doing now with the readmission agreement we all know that the rights of migrants will not be respected in % turkey ] therefore we should not have a readmission agreement whereas we agreed that visa liberalisation is a very important tool
yes there have been important democratic reforms in @ the past year ] but they have been overshadowed by declarations on internet freedom and by the violence against protestors in $ gezi park ]
i too want to remind us of @ fifteen year old ] } berkin elvan ] who died because of injuries caused by tear gas bullets
i am also concerned by attacks on offices of the ` people 's democratic party ] ` halklarn demokratik partisi ] and i hope that this will not prevent the coming elections from being peaceful and free from attacks
furthermore any progress is overshadowed by the current corruption scandal and developments that i can only interpret as a threat to the independence of the justice system
but once again the role of the % eu ] could be much stronger if we were to have a clear commitment to a positive outcome on prospects for membership we would have much stronger leverage if we were to be clear that yes we will accept % turkey ] in our midst if % turkey ] fulfils the & copenhagen ] criteria
this is the only thing that counts and member states should finally be clear about this
mr } fle ] speaks of serious concerns but i have to say with great regret that i think these concerns are now so serious that % turkey ] has ceased to fulfil sufficiently the & copenhagen ]
i think you are absolutely right
i think this is exactly the sort of formulation that people in our country would like to see
i do not like the concept of a ! two ] speed * europe ] because faster sounds better than slower
what i would prefer is a multi centric * europe ] with overlapping circles of engagement a more * europe ] if you like still with the % united kingdom ] remaining at the centre at the core of the % european union ] but not engaging in many of these areas where you want increased integration
on that basis it would be so much easier for % turkey ] to become a member
these pledges must be translated immediately into the concrete action that the people of % yemen ] need and deserve
the humanitarian situation
and to avoid a breeding ground for more violent extremism
@ last year ] this house called for an arms embargo to % saudi arabia ] because of its role in % yemen ] it is a very important signal that we must repeat and at least the call of @ last year ] is still very valid if we look at the incredible and unnecessary suffering of ! millions and millions ] of people
i think the % eu ] must do more develop a shared position and step up its efforts to end this disgusting war and the humanitarian suffering in % yemen ]
of course the ) iranian ] side must also stop fighting a proxy war in % yemen ]
it is high time and this is a real appeal to the ` european external action service ] and the member states that the % eu ] develops a common position vis vis % yemen ] and at least that member states stop exporting weapons to % saudi arabia ] which together with the coalition continues to indiscriminately bomb civilians and block the ports of % hodeidah ] which in turn exacerbates
the violence that has broken out has devastating consequences and will not likely lead to a clear outcome instead everything must be done to find a negotiated solution not only in the interest of the ) yemeni ] people but also to avoid a spillover into an already fragile and explosive region
given that approximately ! seventy five ] of % yemen ] 's food supplies enter the country via this port the devastating consequences of its destruction cannot be underestimated
the growing footprint of ` al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ] in parts of % yemen ] is also of grave concern as are reports that suggest that the ) saudi ] coalition has coordinated its attacks against the ) houthis ] alongside ` aqap ]
this is particularly worrying given the new ) us ] administration 's continued hints that it may seek to play a more decisive role in supporting the ) saudi ] led coalition
! two million ] people have been displaced and over ! half ] of the country 's population lacks access to safe drinking water or sufficient food supplies
the campaign continues to be marked by the disproportionate level of civilian casualties and very poor targeting of ) saudi ] ordinance in their air campaign
! eight hundred ] with humanitarian assistance already struggling to reach those in need there is continued concern that the houthiheld port of % hodeidah ] may be the target of an attack on the ) saudi ] led coalition
the inability to act decisively brings instability to the rest of the world
! one ] ray of hope is the rise of the southern movement
it is possible that we can encourage peace and stability in the south by working with them towards a federal solution even as i 've been saying @ for the past three years ] if it threatens the integrity of the ) yemeni ] state which in my opinion is already a busted flush we must listen to the south ) yemenis ] peaceful call for a say in their future
the country is slipping into famine and this can only get worse as the conflict continues
in addition i have and we have the uncomfortable feeling that the international community and public opinion are turning their eyes from that dramatic conflict attracted by other major global events
why it is important @ today ] to underline this fact
because this conflict can be ended with goodwill and with the support of other major regional and global actors including the % european union ] and it 's right to mention that % iran ] and % saudi arabia ] both being more or less our partners should pay attention and should assume their regional responsibilities because the responsibility there is bearing on their shoulders
yet seriously these large prison populations could swing marginal votes especially at the local level
what about the rights of victims
but are human rights not meant to protect decent law abiding citizens not terrorists hijackers murderers and law breakers
possibly the ) liberal democrats ] because they support this nonsense
is it justice to seek his approval is it right to knock on the cell door of } rose west ] a serial killer securing her support and what of } abu qatada ] } bin laden ] 's right hand man in * europe ]
who will he be voting for
but it seems that a worthy agenda of human rights has now been hijacked by greedy lawyers and political opportunists
now its ` committee of ministers ] has ruled that % britain ] must overturn its ban on allowing prisoners to vote because it violates the human rights of prisoners
what about human responsibilities rather than just rights
so there should be no equivalence of rights between decent law abiding citizens and those of murderers and criminals they forfeited their right to participate in the political process when they took other people 's lives other people 's rights and other people 's property
do you agree with me that
he is now on bail but ! six ] more ) british ] citizens that i know of face extradition and almost inevitable incarceration there
we will make most progress if we approach the human rights agenda in a focused and realistic way we need to target our efforts tackling each case based on a detailed understanding of the country at hand
on human rights as in other areas we have to pull together
in this respect let me refer to the oral question on trade in goods used for torture the % eu ] takes its commitment to the fight against torture very seriously
let me address some specific aspects by making clear that i will continue to meet civil society actors and human rights defenders both in % brussels ] and abroad as i have done in * gaza ] in % china ] and most recently in % brussels ]
we need to review the work we do regularly and to make sure that we get the best use of all available instruments from human rights dialogues to % eu ] guidelines from the european instrument for democracy and human rights to our bilateral assistance and our actions in multilateral
so it is logical that we have developed a strong set of mechanisms for promoting these values in different contexts as the report on human rights and democracy in the world sets out
these will run like a silver thread through everything that we do externally the ` external action service ] once in place will give us the chance to realise our potential and strengthen our ability to speak with ! one ] voice
a good example of being smart and well organised has been our work on promoting the ratification of the & rome statute ] in the run up to the # kampala conference ] @ this year ]
upon my return to % brussels ] i was pleased to receive a letter confirming that the government has now launched this process
therefore as the world changes we also need to make sure that we ask ourselves what we could do better while human rights are universal a one size fits all approach does not work
as this house knows the promise of the & lisbon treaty ] is a more coherent more consistent and hence more effective % eu ] foreign policy
i want to assure this house that work on abolishing the death penalty is a personal priority for
too in the % european union ] we have many tools to help make the world a better place
previous resolutions of this house have called for more information to better assess the effectiveness of our policies
that is what i want to do maximising the potential of the new & lisbon ] set up and continuing to count on your vital support
we must judge our efforts by outcomes even if our contributions to improving human rights situations are an investment over the long term
i share your concern
in that spirit we have invited ` amnesty international ] and the ` omega research foundation ] to present their findings to a meeting @ later this month ] of the ` regulatory committee ] with our member states
our own history of entrenching human rights democracy and the rule of law across ! twenty seven ] member states is a success story and acts as a source of inspiration to others
the work of the ` human rights subcommittee ] and its chair mrs } hautala ] on human rights defenders is an extremely good example of this and i very much welcome the report and its findings and pay tribute to those who have worked so hard on it
me i will see to it that work advances both bilaterally and in multilateral fora beginning with the ` united nations ] in @ september ]
looking ahead i want to see what more we can do to support the abolition of the death penalty worldwide
we need to mobilise and connect them better
this is also a chance for our work on human rights democracy and the rule of law
we have worked with specific countries offering % eu ] support at delegation and headquarters levels working with member states and the ) eu ] presidency to name just ! one ] success story when i visited the % seychelles ] @ last month ] i discussed a range of issues on which they and the % eu ] could strengthen our cooperation with piracy as a top priority
i also raised the ` icc ] and encouraged the president mr } michel ] to submit the ratification bill to ` parliament ]
that does not mean we should change the message on the importance of human rights but there is room to be smarter in how we deliver it
we need the continued commitment of member states of this house and of the other % eu ] institutions
on many occasions the house has stated its commitment to this subject
with its integrated structure the new service should help to ensure that human rights issues are reflected in all areas of our external action including csdp development and trade
i expect colleagues in delegations and here in % brussels ] to do the same
fora revisiting our overall % eu ] human rights strategy could be a useful exercise and i intend to launch a consultation process to inform the development of a new human rights strategy this
to give just ! one ] example over the @ last eighteen months ] we have provided ( eur two hundred and thirty five million ] in funding for ! nine hundred ] ngo projects in ! one hundred ] countries this work is extremely important and it must continue but we are not the only actor and ours is not the only economic and political success story
we must pay tribute to the defenders of human rights wherever they may be in % iran ] in * gaza ] in % cyprus ] or thanks to the convention in the ) english ] countryside
thanks to the convention we now have to fight for those rights in the fields and lanes of rural % england ]
they are prepared to lie down in the road at great personal risk in order to stop convoys of lorries from delivering concrete and asphalt these are hardworking law abiding citizens who only want to protect their own rights and those of their families
this may seem trivial when compared to the plight of so many people in the world but the point i am trying to make is that human rights are in danger everywhere
with the protection of the convention travellers enjoy special privileges in health care and education services built up at great expenses by successive generations
i also believe very much that in order to have a say on human rights in the world we need to be able to look at problems within the % eu ]
the example of the torture tools shows that we are far from being perfect we are not living up to expectations and our own commitments
we have to use them wisely to promote human rights
i also believe that in the near future we should have the courage to look at the contribution and involvement of some of our member states in the ` cia ] renditions in the fight against terrorism i know it is a very sensitive subject but i think we should have the courage to look at this again
many very important things were said
this would be the least i think we can do to make a positive contribution
there are incredible prison conditions within the % european union ]
the ` external action service ] will lead to a more effective and coordinated ) european ] foreign policy and human rights deserve ongoing attention in an integrated comprehensive manner
many have fled and they could have an opportunity if they could be taken into * europe ] as human rights defenders and dissidents they could be considered an asset in developing our policies and should not just be seen as a threat or a burden
@ this week ] it has been @ one year since ] the presidential elections took place in % iran ] and they mark the beginning of a renewed and brutal crack down by the regime against its own people
% iran ] 's regime serves as an example of all these violations
as challenging as this is we cannot allow this to be a zero sum game versus human rights
sanctions will be imposed by the ` un ] and the % european union ] but i am not necessarily optimistic about the concrete results that these will render
i just want to stress that we as members of the ` european parliament ] from all political groups have just launched a written declaration on behalf of the ) european ] people to support the ) iranian ] people and their call for human rights
empowering the population and standing up for their rights as autonomously legitimate may also render bottom up reforms domestic opposition thus far seems to move the ) iranian ] regime more than international sanctions so this is a clear indicator
% iran ] is on our political agendas but the international community is mainly preoccupied with the nuclear challenge
this is just ! one ] reminder of the brutal things people do to each other and the practices we really have to stop
unfortunately we have a sad competition of geographical areas where human rights violations take place as well as horizontal issues such as women 's rights and freedom of expression that need attention because they are being violated
over the @ past year ] the regime has cut off the minimal freedoms that the population still had and has virtually silenced the opposition
i also want to welcome in this debate the annual human rights report and the painstaking work that is carried out at different levels in good faith for this % european union ] to honour our human rights obligations i welcome the growing number and importance of our human rights dialogues with ~ third ] countries reflected in the report but the dialogues like the report itself cannot be an end in themselves
it will be a crucial test of whether we mean what we say
i want to place on record that we are discussing ideas such as maintaining a horizontal human rights directorate vesting human rights responsibility at assistant secretary general level as well as maintaining human rights desks in each geographic directorate and in every % eu ] delegation worldwide
mr president history teaches us that usually countries with the highest standards of human rights are also the most prosperous and peaceful
we should therefore be proud of what the % eu ] has achieved in this respect but those achievements compel us to redouble our efforts to promote human rights around the world
we are currently faced with many egregious examples of wanton disregard of human rights
look at % north korea ] where isolation means we can only surmise what horrific abuses are actually taking place there in their concentration camps particularly for those attempting to flee that brutal ) stalinist ] nightmare
and what exactly does their army get up to in the * north caucasus ] we do not really know
of course human rights cannot and must not be the sole arbiter of the % eu ] 's relations with ~ third ] countries
the % people 's republic of china ] for example enjoys a growing economic and strategic relationship with the % union ] but continues to brutally suppress fundamental freedoms and even censors the internet
we have similar links to % saudi arabia ] where alcoholics are beheaded and % pakistan ] which bans the ) ahmadi muslims ]
we need to be realistic about what we can actually achieve but we should never stop trying to convince others of the virtues of our democratic values that have served us so well and are the universal sign of a civilised society
prohibiting the trade in instruments that can be used exclusively for torture is one very useful action that the % eu ] can take in demonstrating that we do take this issue very seriously indeed
as the votes in the ` human rights subcommittee ] showed in @ april ] the report enjoys great support across different groups as the issue of protection of human rights remains of joint interest to us all we reached good compromises taking into account the different points of view the % eu ] has already worked out mechanisms and tools of great value
so as i have already emphasised in previous discussions we have to make sure that we achieve better implementation of the existing guidelines with the evaluation of existing policies developing more effective protection finally i strongly encourage member states
to show stronger political will to support the action of human rights defenders as the report highlights with the & lisbon treaty ] in place it is important that the protection and security of human rights defenders be made a priority issue in the % eu ] 's relationship with ~ third ] countries
and integrated at all levels of the % union ] 's foreign policy in order to increase the coherence effectiveness and credibility of the % eu ] 's support for human rights
sometimes the important parts of our work get overtaken by the urgent and i do believe this ` parliament ] has a critical role to play in making sure that we remain true to the founding values that are spelt out in the & treaty of lisbon ] and i quote respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights including the rights of persons belonging to minorities
a number of honourable members have talked about human rights defenders and the importance and significance of continuing the dialogue with them
i have already made it clear that where we can we are working to meet with human rights defenders everywhere that i visit in the world and indeed to invite and see human rights defenders in % brussels ] in my office recently i met with women from % afghanistan ] to talk about their particular concerns
we will continue to do this
it is an integral part of how the ` external action service ] should operate i know that mrs } de keyser ] cannot be here now but i do take her points very much on looking forward on electoral observation we do need to look again at having a more coherent strategy both in terms of the preparation for electoral missions but also better monitoring in the follow up to that
her work in monitoring in % sudan ] very much feeds into the way in which i want to take this forward when we have the service operational so that we get better at what we do and we use the information and knowledge more effectively
these are important values that need to be consistently applied to people everywhere regardless but we need to be sure that we understand what they mean and how we should approach their implementation
it is not about special rights
it is about enabling people to be able to access the rights that they are entitled to
that sometimes means that we have to examine how best to support people
honourable members who like me have worked in the field of those with disabilities will know that actually accessing human rights for disabled people requires us to make positive changes
sometimes that is true in other parts of the world and in other communities as well but we also need that level of consistency which a number of honourable members have paid attention to
in the declaration on political accountability which will be a feature of what we do as we move forward with the ` external action service ] i have foreseen the strengthening of exchange of information and access to documents which i hope will help honourable members in some of the comments that have been made on that
as for structures i am in discussion on structures but i am not going to be bound into having structures that actually prevent us from dealing with human rights as effectively as i would like
we are ensuring that human rights is a feature of all of the work of all of the delegations but i believe it is a feature of what everybody should be doing
it is not a silver thread if we simply put it in a box called human rights and put it in a corner
too often that is what i see organisations doing and i will not do that with the ` external action service ]
it has to be a clear part of everything i do and everything that all those involved do
unfortunately we have not found favour with all member states
in terms of the accession to the & european convention on human rights ] it is an important objective very definitely within the & lisbon treaty ] and we are glad that we have the mandate to work to complete that
but it will be done in parallel with the membership of the individual member states in terms of the obligations that we have
i have particularly noted the important comments that have been made that will help me be guided for the future and i pay tribute again to the ` human rights committee ] for the work that they have done
& fatca ] breaches the right to data privacy of the & european convention on human rights ] and the big financial barriers to renouncing citizenship breach & article fifteen of the universal declaration of human rights ]
she didn 't even know that she was accidentally an ) american ] citizen because she was born there
born to ) british ] parents and having gone to school in % britain ] worked all her life in % britain ] and retired in % britain ] she 's now being chased down like a criminal by the % usa ]
so you think that international relations are more important than the interests of your own citizens
we are talking about at least ! one hundred and ten ] ! zero ] citizens in just ! seven ] countries of the % european union ] so we are probably talking ! hundreds of thousands ]
) americans ] decide on their own system
and we are not just talking about basic bank accounts we are talking about getting a mortgage loan to buy a house which i think is a fundamental right or a business loan for an sme which we were just talking about
maybe it would be a good start even before the summer break to show a little more concern for the interests of ) european ] citizens
why are you saying that it doesn 't concern you
apparently then it was our concern
it is our prime concern and you know what the funny thing is there are only ! two ] countries in the world that have citizen based taxation
so what is different now
so i expect the ` european council ] to start talks with the % united states ] about the abolition of citizen based taxation or at the very least an exemption for % eu ] citizens because it is your duty
! one ] is the % us ] the other is % eritrea ] and when % eritrea ] came here to * europe ] and tried to impose taxes on ) eritrean ] citizens here everybody reacted
you have just started your presidency
but then i made a request for access to documents and i got ! fourteen ] ! zero ] documents correspondence between the ` european commission ] and the ) us ] authorities on & fatca ] so
so if you can tell % eritrea ] off surely you can tell the % united states ] off too
we hardly have any talks with the ) americans ] about this
what you are saying is that you consider your relationship with the ) american ] authorities more important than the rights of citizens
that 's funny and the other thing that is also funny is that when i started to dig into this @ six years ago ] i got the same answer oh you know taxation there is nothing we can do
the impact on citizens if the situation of citizens is not your concern then what are you doing here
therefore in @ two thousand and sixteen ] a collective of ) european ] citizens from nine different member states submitted a petition to ` parliament ] to my committee alerting us via the committee about the impact of & fatca ] and its implementing intergovernmental
results in heavy fines for financial institutions many of them in the % eu ] have responded by avoiding all commercial business with customers presenting any % us ] connection whether actual or not
they testified to the violation of various fundamental principles of % eu ] law including the right to respect for private life the prohibition of discrimination and data protection rules as well as the & eu payment accounts directive ] all this was brought to our attention
they are in many cases completely unaware that they are ) us ] citizens
in addition financial institutions have to disclose detailed information on accounts held by presumed socalled ) us ] persons to the ` us internal revenue service ] via their national governments
in practice & fatca ] has affected a large number of citizens in * europe ] such as citizens who are nationals of both the % usa ] and an % eu ] member state and in particular the socalled accidental ) americans ] who by accident of birth inherited ) us ] citizenship but who maintain no ties at all to the % usa ] never having lived worked or studied there
the lives and livelihoods of ! thousands ] of citizens in the % eu ] are at stake here
however more than @ eight years ] after & fatca ] 's adoption while unilateralism and protectionism unfortunately appear to be the cornerstones of ) us ] foreign policy it is now high time to assess the extraterritorial effects of & fatca ]
their family members are also affected these issues need to be addressed at % eu ] level all together
those falling within the definition of ) us ] persons have their savings accounts frozen they have no access to banking services including life insurance pensions and mortgages due to the reluctance of financial institutions to follow the & fatca ] reporting
on ! thousands ] and ! thousands ] of law abiding ) eu ] citizens and their families
this and i am eager to convey this message to the commission this evening could constitute a breach of % eu ] data protection rules and % eu ] fundamental rights and therefore it requires further investigation
and do not hold ) us ] social security numbers
and to tell you the truth it was shocking
& fatca ] requires foreign financial institutions to search for ) us ] persons by looking at a variety of indicators including indicators of power of attorney over the account of a ) us ] person with a ) us ] address against which the individual is required to prove that he or she is not a ) us ] person because noncompliance with the requirement imposed
agreements on ) european ] citizens
we trust that the commission will carefully assess whether it has been correctly implemented by all member states and will take any appropriate measures in the case of any breach
therefore it is not for the ` council ] to interpret the legal provisions concerning taxpayers in specific non % eu ] countries
@ two thousand and twelve ] in @ july two thousand and fourteen ] ` parliament ] and the ` council ] enacted a & payment accounts directive ] which has been in application since @ september two thousand and sixteen ] and all member states have notified transposition of the measures contained in the directive
therefore the same data protection rules apply to all data subjects who are in the % european union ] including % eu ] citizens and residents irrespective of which member state they are staying in
in light of these considerations the possibility for the negotiation of an % eu ] % us ] agreement on & fatca ] has not been discussed by the ` council ]
the & gdpr ] provides that processing of personal data such as the disclosure of personal data on bank accounts is only lawful if its processing has a legal basis such as an international agreement between an % eu ] member state and the % us ] moreover the & gdpr ] applies to the processing of personal data regardless of whether the processing of the data takes place within the % european union ] or not
the double taxation situations which can arise from that principle are solved through bilateral agreements based on international arrangements such as the ` oecd ] ones it is not the role of the ` council ] either to interpret intergovernmental agreements concluded by member states and the % us ] or to evaluate the impact that they may have on citizens
however it is for the commission to assess the implementation of % eu ] legislation by the member states and in particular the correct transposition of the & payment accounts directive ]
when it comes to the us legislation on fatca and its possible extraterritorial effects let me state the following it is a principle of international law that the sovereignty of each state implies that it can freely define its taxpayers
tax residents
which is currently being implemented by over ! one hundred ] jurisdictions
should member states not enforce this directive the commission will decide on appropriate measures including the launching of an infringement procedure
nevertheless it should be borne in mind that similar reporting obligations are required under the & directive on administrative cooperation ] and at international level through the ` oecd ] global standard for automatic exchange of financial information
they have concluded bilateral agreements with the % united states ] based on the same model
this has been acknowledged at international level and in the tax treaties signed by the % us ] with all member states
the commission understands that one of the practical problems that % eu ] financial institutions are confronted with is that they need a % us ] tax identification or social security number to report the financial information required under & fatca ] to the % united states ] tax authorities
as ` parliament ] rightly states in the oral question % us ] tax rules are based on citizenship
this includes accidental ) americans ] people who were born in the % united states ] or to % united states ] parents and who may not have any other connection to the % united states ]
national legislation implementing the agreements has to be in line with the requirements of % eu ] data protection law and the & eu charter of fundamental rights ]
as a result anyone holding % us ] citizenship anyone residing mostly in the % united states ] or entitled to permanent residence in the % united states ] will be subject to % us ] tax obligations
however customers who are subject to & fatca ] may not have such a number and obtaining it seems to be cumbersome and potentially costly
concerning the possible discrimination towards consumers and their right to payment accounts all consumers who are legally resident in the % eu ] including real and accidental ) americans ] are entitled to open a basic payment account irrespective of their nationality or member state of residence under the & payment accounts directive ]
at the same time the commission acknowledges that & fatca ] and the related intergovernmental agreements may have the unintended effect of hindering access to financial services in the % eu ] for persons regarded by the ) us ] authorities as ) american ] citizens or
i would also like to underline that the information exchange requirements under the act as such are similar to those in our % eu ] directive on mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation and to the ` oecd ] global & standard for automatic exchange of financial account information ]
applause ~ secondly ] i think what my colleague ms } wikstrm ] said an impact assessment needs to be done to establish the extent of this and to find out what actually is happening in the greatest detail
also you mentioned the & general data protection regulation ] & gdpr ] which has come in in @ may ]
if it is it has to stop because i think we have to ensure that our citizens are protected from & fatca ] being applied by the fat cats of the ) american ] revenue commissioners
madam president i would like to thank you again for raising this issue and making us aware of the difficulties faced by accidental ) americans ]
i have heard also the input from the commission and from the meps who stayed late > this evening ] to fight for the people affected and i fully appreciate this
i understand some member states have been in contact bilaterally with the % us ] authorities over concerns linked to the implementation of & fatca ]
on to take collective action since member states have been dealing with this issue individually in close cooperation with the % us ]
and i would state that again because what we are talking about here are bilateral agreements
nevertheless the & payment account directive ] contains a detailed review clause
the commission has been requested both by the ` council ] and by the ` european parliament ] to submit a report @ three years ] after implementation of the directive accompanied by any appropriate proposals
the report will deal in particular with infringements to the application of the directive
the report should also highlight the number of credit institutions offering payment accounts with basic features the associate fees the characteristics of the consumers who have opened payment accounts with basic features as well as best practices for reducing consumers exclusion from access to payment services
however the presidency will of course remain available for exchanges on the subject as needed and is ready to be in touch with the commission
i hope that i was able to clarify the situation and i thank you again for your attention
finally the } marie curie ] reintegration grants have been restructured and simplified into a single career integration grant action which specifically addresses the issue of the brain drain
however the commission is aware that such an approach has potential drawbacks for example length of negotiation procedures and it is perceived differently by different stakeholders
the average time to grant in the ~ seventh ] framework programme fp seven is in the order of @ three hundred and forty days ] about @ one month ] shorter than in the ~ sixth ] framework program fp
high risk high gain projects are in particular expected in the ideas specific programme which is implemented by the ` european research council ]
! one ] of the options the commission has put forward for further discussion with the other institutions and stakeholders relates to the move towards a results based approach using lump sums for whole projects
within the endeavour of creating a ) european ] research area the administrative harmonisation between national and ) european ] research funding systems is a long term objective which is shared by the commission era nets in fp six and fp seven are contributing to this goal and the joint programming initiatives will bring more progress
preliminary analyses show that the selection process designed by the ` european research council ] is successful in challenging the funding to these high risk high gain projects the marie curie actions are a key instrument to reverse the persistent trend towards a brain drain of researchers
in @ april of this year ] the commission adopted a communication on simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes proposing a whole set of measures including gradual improvements but also profound changes requiring a revision of the legal basis of % eu ] research and a rebalancing between trust and control and between risk taking and risk avoidance
! six ] while the commission acknowledges that there is room for further acceleration of the relevant processes benchmarking with national funders shows that for projects of comparable complexity a time to grant in the order of @ one year ] is certainly not unusual
as a further step a stakeholder 's platform for common principles for external funding in the ` era ] was established recently
this approach would remove the obligation to produce detailed cost statements by introducing lump sums for entire projects and linking the payments exclusively to the reporting on scientific technical progress
! four seven billion ] in fp ! seven ] } marie curie ] actions will equip about ! fifty ] ! zero ] researchers including ! ten ] ! zero ] phd candidates with innovative skills that will enhance their career prospects in both the public and private sector and will prepare them for the jobs of the future
the commission therefore suggests studying all implementation details and potential impacts thoroughly before making concrete legislative proposals
~ first ] the commission is determined to make the programmes as accessible as possible to smes by simplifying procedures as far as possible while of course ensuring sound financial management
the commission will bring forward these measures as rapidly as possible and propose changes to the legal framework if necessary
~ fourthly ] the ` enterprise europe ] network set up in @ two thousand and eight ] within the competitiveness and innovation programme provides services to smes encouraging their participation in fp
the commission is committed to increasing the participation of small and medium sized enterprises in % eu ] research programmes and to help them ultimately bring the fruits of their innovation to market
through these measures and actions it is expected that around ! twenty ] ! zero ] smes will benefit directly from fp seven by the end of the programme
~ thirdly ] another initiative that equally supports smes is eurostars a joint research and development programme with ` eureka ] involving ! twenty six ] member states and ! six ] associated countries it targets rd performing smes in projects close to the market
this is a priority for the commission and will remain so for the remainder of its mandate
! seven ] more precisely this network together and in full complementarity with the national contact points assists smes providing support for awareness raising capacity building for participation in fp seven engaging new smes and fp seven proposals partner search joint actions addressed to smes and conducting consultations for inclusion of sme related call topics in work programmes
the commission has brought forward a communication on simplification that was formally transmitted to ` parliament ] and ` council ] on @ twenty nine april this year ] and in which several new short and longer term measures are suggested including the introduction of lump sum payments to cover the personnel costs of owner managers of smes
finally an e learning platform specifically designed for smes is planned to go on line in
in this regard several concrete steps have already been taken such as reducing the need for audit certificates fewer ex ante financial capacity checks and protective measures and streamlined project reporting
! one ] of the current ongoing studies is a feasibility study to assess the possibilities opportunities and needs for ) european ] level legislation against gender based violence and violence against children
the commission has welcomed the adoption of ` parliament ] resolutions on violence against women and on equality between women and men including the ` parliament ] resolution on the elimination of violence against women
violence against women cannot be justified on the grounds of customs tradition or religious considerations
we are determined to strengthen our action with both legislative and soft measures to eradicate violence against women including female genital mutilation and to use all means within the % eu ] 's competence
comprehensive action to combat violence against women is a key point in that strategy
this is reflected in the commission 's communication of @ april two thousand and ten ] on the stockholm programme which puts emphasis on the protection of victims of crime including female victims of violence and genital mutilation respecting the commitments of our action plan implementing the stockholm programme the commission is currently working on its strategy to combat violence against women
prevention and awareness raising activities will be a key point in the commission 's strategy
the commission confirms its strong commitment to combating violence against women
@ last march ] the commission strengthened its commitment to promoting gender equality and fighting violence against women by presenting a women 's charter as discussed in the plenary of the ` european parliament ] on @ fifteen june ] the charter proposes to put in place a coordinated and effective policy framework to tackle violence against women
the commission took note of ` parliament ] 's proposal for a directive on combating and preventing violence against women
the ` european research council ] has a part to play in delivering all ! three ]
last but not least the ` erc ] has also been successful in serving as a benchmark for the competitiveness of national innovation systems
this was acknowledged in the independent review carried out in @ july two thousand and nine ] by a panel of ! six ] eminent experts and although the ~ first ] projects did not begin until the @ second half of two thousand and eight ] many are already showing highly promising and exploitable results
they have created a start up company which is developing bioactive materials that can be used instead of bone grafts to treat bone diseases and difficult fractures
this requires us to strengthen every link in the innovation chain from blue sky research to commercialisation
a research team at ` frankfurt university ] published important results showing how to improve blood circulation by blocking certain genetic fragments this has huge potential for new therapy for heart attacks and the researchers have applied for a patent on their method
in order to achieve the creation of an innovation union the ~ first ] condition to be fulfilled is reinforcing our knowledge base and promoting excellence and this is precisely what the ` erc ] is already doing
most obviously smart growth means developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation
so projects that are designed to answer fundamental research questions generate the radically new ideas that will drive new innovation and are also necessary to tackle society 's grand challenges
the key to * europe ] 's future prosperity rests on the quality of its ideas and the ability to turn them into products processes and services that people from all over the world will want to buy
for example researchers at $ imperial college ] in % london ] published groundbreaking results on the quality of bone like materials grown in laboratories that can be implanted with real bones to help repair them
it has been instrumental in catalysing reforms of national funding systems in a number of countries such as % france ] % poland ] % portugal ] and % sweden ]
in a remarkably short time the ` erc ] has gained world wide recognition as a world class research funding agency
i think that ! one ] of the biggest difficulties being faced is the ongoing cost of the damage because there was a further series of floodings shortly after the @ november ] one was an issue and discussed
so maybe we should look at long term management plans as well as just immediate funding
but are there any checks in place to see what happens after funding has been given to ensure that the specific company does not make workers redundant in any of the other ! twenty six ] member states
it is likely that we will be able to get to the question by mr } iacolino ] but i am afraid that questions ! twenty eight ] ! twenty nine ] ! thirty ] and ! thirty one ] will be answered in writing
the ~ second ] reference is in & article fifty seven ] which stipulates that managing authorities or member states must ensure that cofunded investments are maintained for at least @ five years ] after completion of the operation
the commission and the member states must ensure that undertakings which are or have been the subject of a recovery procedure do not receive a contribution from the funds following the transfer of a productive activity between regions within the member state or to another member state
managing authorities must inform the commission in their annual implementation reports of operations that have not met the requirements for the maintenance of investment provided for in that article and the commission is to inform the other member states
lastly in accordance with the publicity requirements member states sharing management of % european union ] funds have to publish a list of beneficiaries of operations and the corresponding amounts of public funding
the ~ first ] is in recital ! forty two ] which states that when appraising major productive investment projects the commission should have all necessary information to consider whether the financial contribution from the funds does not result in a substantial loss of jobs in existing locations within the % european union ]
the managing authority designated by the member state is responsible for managing and implementing operational programmes
laying down general provisions on the european regional development fund the european social fund and the cohesion fund
the commission has set up a state aid web based search tool which provides information on state aid cases and on block exemption cases recorded
information on esf beneficiaries can be found on the social fund 's website
the commission is assisted in the monitoring of restructuring activities by the ` european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions ] with the european restructuring monitor
where an operation fails to meet that requirement the % eu ] contribution should be recovered
in order to ensure that community funding does not support relocation within the % european union ]
so perhaps if the member will allow me i will respond to it at that stage
it is important to emphasise the political point that we do need an interinstitutional agreement with regard to the operation of the % eu ] research programmes
the rules that will govern the workings of our % eu ] research programmes have to be clearly defined and very importantly have to be consistent applicants to the research programmes whether they are ~ third ] level educational institutions research centres or private sector companies
must know exactly how our % eu ] research funded initiatives are going to operate in a very practical sense for them
simplifying those programmes is a key political priority for us for me and for the commission as a whole and we need to work in a very clear determined manner and in partnership with ` parliament ] to be able to achieve that further simplification
it is an issue that needs a comprehensive response
that proposal is under discussion and i am very much aware of the feeling in ` parliament ] regarding where the financing comes from in relation to iter but it is a project that is ground breaking and can bring incredible benefits not just to * europe ] but to the world as a whole if it is successful
so we are working very carefully strongly and coherently with our international partners to be able to move this project forward
i have no doubt that we will be able to do that with your cooperation and your support
unfortunately i do not have the specific information that the honourable member asked for in relation to the countries of the south
however i should say that the ` european research council ] bases its response to applications purely on excellence
that is i feel the reason why they have gained such an internationally known reputation very quickly because it is recognised that their decisions are based purely on excellence
i should say that the ` european research council ] will launch @ next year ] a proof of concept funding option that has the objective of bridging the funding gap in the earliest stages of the innovation process where for example a potential commercial concept needs verification through testing or prototypes or indeed through the identification of an appropriate market or through the creation of a protectable intellectual property right
it is also interesting to see that a number of member states including in the south are now looking at the concept of the ` european research council ] in deciding that perhaps they themselves should look at establishing a research council within their own territory
i think it right to put that before you
will you accept @ today ] in this chamber that the & structural fund regulation ] 's requirements both for additionality and for partnership are fundamental and that you will ensure without hesitation that they will be respected in any new structure
~ firstly ] i think that the commissioner might have been able to come to my question but i have no problem because it is related to this
to * europe ] 's south the picture is just as bad ) west african ] fishermen whose lifestyle had been sustained for generations are being forced to switch to people trafficking because % eu ] registered vessels have helped fish their waters to extinction
it is time to restore control of the seas and fishing grounds to the sovereign nations whose track record has shown them fit to exercise such stewardship
it is time for the % eu ] to acknowledge that its record in maritime management is the worst in the entire world a typical example of what is known as the tragedy of the commons the phenomenon by which shared resources always get exploited ruthlessly because anyone who exercises restraint is disadvantaged by the unscrupulous
we welcome the report 's suggestions on maritime governance on sea basin initiatives and strategies on maritime spatial planning and surveillance a maritime research framework and observation and data network and a fund for maritime infrastructure
when it comes to the votes > later on today ] i would particularly like to ask members to support the rapporteur 's amendment which seeks to include the option of including emission trading schemes in the % eu ] and ` imo ] rules this was an issue
that was the commission 's intent back in @ two thousand and nine ] when it announced a more horizontal policy approach on areas such as maritime transport the marine environment and regional and fisheries policies @ today ] we see the response of the ` committee on transport and tourism ] to this fresh direction in the shape of mrs } meissner ] 's report
we will be supporting this report
i am particularly pleased that the report now includes the integration of carbon emission reduction targets and support for renewable solar and wind energies on board vessels
however we believe there is still much work to be done
i would ask members to show some ! twenty ] ! twenty ] vision and vote for the rapporteur 's amendment which recognises that these measures sit squarely alongside our wider strategic objectives around co two reduction and the europe two thousand and twenty project
i enquired in @ two thousand and seven ] of the ` uk marine and fisheries agency ] how many fish were being caught in ) british ] waters
mr president it should not surprise anybody that the % eu ] wants to integrate maritime policy just as it intends to integrate everything else across * europe ] in every aspect of life and public policy
so the % uk ] no longer has its own territorial waters
i think she should be very pleased that ! thirty seven ] speakers contributed to the debate indeed we had a very lively debate which has thrown up fresh ideas to encourage us to aim even higher in terms of the maritime policies that we pursue
i turn now to a number of specific questions raised
furthermore maritime surveillance is an important new initiative which is set to engineer a huge change in all future actions by maritime authorities at sea and aims to install a common information sharing environment for the % eu ] maritime domain
the proposal will be accompanied by a detailed report that will also include the outcome of our ex post impact assessment relating to the ` imo ] decision as well as possible measures that the commission could take to mitigate undesired impacts on the sector
i believe that we can now pursue the implementation of all future maritime initiatives with renewed vigour and confidence
the % eu ] is aware of different situations in sea basins and is developing appropriate strategies for each sea basin tailored to specific needs
thank you and my apologies to the interpreters if i was speaking too quickly
we must manage the finances of the % eu ] concerning maritime issues in the context of the ` european commission ] 's proposal for a regulation to finance the integrated maritime policy in @ two thousand and eleven ] @ two thousand and twelve ] and @ two thousand and thirteen ] the purpose of the proposed funding namely of ( eur fifty million ] is to continue the work undertaken @ since two thousand and seven ] to remove policy barriers and to unleash synergies by bridging all policies that impact on the sea such as transport fisheries customs and marine
the commission looks forward to working with ` parliament ] on the timely entry into force of this regulation so that we can implement our future integrated maritime policy actions
on sulphur emissions the commission is fully aware of the concerns expressed by industry groups about the impacts that may occur due to the new marine fuel quality standards adopted by the ` imo ] in
the sector connects the ) irish ] economy with the rest of * europe ] and the rest of the world
i do not however support the resurrection of the concept of a ) european ] coastguard
i believe it is far too expensive at a time of financial stringency
can i also mention in this context the impact of offshore wind wave and tidal energy projects together with the designation of marine protected areas mpas on inshore and artisanal fisheries
we cannot simply draw lines on maps designating vast areas of inshore waters as mpas or for renewable energy
small scale fishermen cannot be arbitrarily displaced without full consultation
the designation of such areas must be a bottom up and not a top down process and it must involve stakeholder consultation
madam president @ last march ] the ` ecdpc ] and the ` who ] released data showing that new tb cases and deaths in the ! fifty three ] countries of the ` who ] ) european ] region declined @ each year ] by
of greater concern is that this increase coincides with persistently high rates of drug resistant tb which threatens progress towards eliminating tb by
in my opinion national governments should rapidly implement screening programmes in order to identify those people in need of treatment
we have no chance to solve only through instruments of health ministers
on development this consensus commits us to invest in preventing and combatting communicable diseases and securing affordable medicines and
tb for example is ! one ] of the most seriously neglected and underestimated health human rights and poverty problems of our era
we have the responsibility to do more and in particular we need to address the taboos that surround infectious diseases
not to work together and not to consider everyone is not an option we should not only consider curing people by treatment but also comprehensively implement preventive measures to ensure that fewer people become infected
the impact of these diseases on overall health status and socioeconomic well being especially of the most vulnerable is vast
inaction and inadequate action are no longer acceptable
these infectious diseases are a major threat to the rights of the child adolescents women and their families and the social impacts are disproportionate while the stigma is devastating
we have the opportunity to act but we need all together to act now
must fulfil economic and financial policy conditions to be agreed between the % eu ] and % ukraine ] in a memorandum of understanding
% ukraine ] needs to go on with its reforms the most crucial ones being the fight against corruption reforming the security forces and the taxation system and making the business environment better
therefore the sanctions against % russia ] must be prolonged until the & minsk agreements ] are fully implemented
! one eighty three billion ] ! a billion ] will go to the people of % ukraine ] and * eur ]
that cannot be allowed to happen so the commission must monitor this money very closely
however i think it is vital that we do not just give the money but that we insist as the commission has indicated it will that human rights reforms are genuine in % ukraine ] that corruption is properly tackled in % ukraine ] that democracy is properly embedded in % ukraine ] and above all that the money does not end up in the pockets of oligarchs
that was ! one ] reason why a colleague asked if the minister is sure that the people of % ukraine ] will keep up with and support the pace of the reforms
of course i have heard critics say that we are not sure whether the money will be used transparently or whether there are enough incentives for reform in the report
% ukraine ] needs our unity in order to sustain clear reasoning for their reforms just @ yesterday ] we had an opportunity to talk to the ) ukrainian ] minister of the economy
fighting the oligarchic structures battling corruption and addressing inefficiency in the public sector are just a few of the points that he raised
our foes would rejoice if they saw us disunited and would use it for their propaganda
it is chilling to imagine any of our countries going through those sorts of reforms actually changing dramatically many fields of life that people were accustomed to
it seemed to me that even the critics should have been convinced that % ukraine ] is doing its utmost to reform itself
if we want the country which is still fighting for its territory to be able to stabilise its budget and economy we have to agree on providing the funds as soon as possible
he gave us a cold but clear overview on the reforms that his ministry and the government are undertaking
! one eight billion ] of macro financial aid to % ukraine ] which will be the biggest financial package given by the % european union ] to any ~ third ] country
when the situation in % ukraine ] stabilises and i want to believe that it will we will come back to the debate on how we can help % ukraine ] on its path to reform
it has to be noted that our friends as well as our adversaries are looking for cracks in our unity
dear colleagues i call on you to support this report as presented without amendments and to demonstrate our resolution to stand by % ukraine ]
we were reassured that with a clear message from * europe ] that * europe ] is standing by them the people will support and understand the need for reform
as you know amendments to the commission proposal could trigger a ~ second ] reading and significantly delay the adoption process
% ukraine ] is facing massive liquidity problems % ukraine ] is on the verge of bankruptcy and i am absolutely certain that the bankruptcy of % ukraine ] would be worse than a full scale invasion of % ukraine ]
when you are at war you do not reform the state and save up for winter at the same time
~ first ] we should provide support to a neighbouring country which is struggling with a massive economic and humanitarian crisis and is the victim of outright military aggression from % russia ]
this is not only our moral obligation it is also a very sensible political decision because we are providing support to a pro ) european ] pro reform and democratic government and in this way we contribute to our own security
it is also a sign of our sense of responsibility for stability in the region
having said that i have to call on the commission to make sure that the money is spent on support for the reform process and on state building in % ukraine ] because we have to make sure that this assistance benefits all the people of % ukraine ]
it is our responsibility as partners and allies of % ukraine ] to provide financial support but it is also our responsibility to help % ukraine ] with long term rather than short term solutions
these solutions are reforms reforms to restore confidence by reinforcing the rule of law tackling corruption and taking measures to improve the business environment
my country % estonia ] went through these painful reforms for the long term benefits of a sustainable future
the ) israeli ] government has a clear commitment to applying these standards
we judged it on its own merits and approved it
remember that we had an agreement and a debate on an agreement with % palestine ] quite recently actually and at that time we had the courage not to do what we are doing here
but sadly this house has managed to hijack this question and make it into another part of the ) israeli ] ) palestinian ] conflict to the detriment of patients throughout * europe ]
that is what it is all about
it is important to mention @ today ] that there are instruments in place to detect cases of abuse
we all know that this protocol has been under consideration in the ` european parliament ] for more than @ two years ]
the ` alde group ] hopes the answer to this oral question will provide clarity so that we can put the protocol to a vote
however with or without this protocol i once again urge the ) israeli ] government to stop the illegal settlements and to move closer to the % eu ] and the international community
if nothing else the procedural journey that this protocol has made through the % eu ] makes us all less credible and that is not what we need
however to appropriately address the serious problem of the illegal settlements that the current government of % israel ] continues to build this may not be the tool
to start with this protocol means we are turning procedures upside down and that will have an adverse effect
clearly the % eu ] has a responsibility to lead in protecting and promoting universal human rights worldwide
when we talk about the technical implementation of a protocol to a trade agreement some context and background are important as it is undeniable that the political discussions have taken the upper hand in this house when dealing with this dossier
when it comes to % israel ] or the * middle east ] peace process we have to be careful not to be so divisive ourselves that we become part of the problem instead of the solution
we either have to use the conditionality at association agreement level or find other ways
we believe trade agreements are an important lever and i think we should not shy away from firmly invoking conditionality clauses especially those on human rights
mr president today we are discussing the oral question that seeks to clarify in a binding way appropriate measures to ensure that the % eu ] will not import medicines or other pharmaceutical products from the * occupied territories ]
it is then up to members of this house to vote according to their conscience as we always do even on difficult and politicised issues
getting by on a day by day basis is not the same as a sustainable ! two ] state solution which moves further away with every settlement built
it goes beyond the concrete and entirely justified questions which have been posed to the commission today in relation to the legal and constitutional concerns about acaa
a number of meps argue in favour because they say that ) eu ] patients would have access to a broader range of generic and branded medicines
this debate is not a technical debate it is a political debate and the heart of the question again which we come back to time and again on international trade agreements and related aspects here in ` parliament ] is whether the commitments in words to human rights by the ` european parliament ] and the % eu ] will last when faced with commercial interests of ) european ] big business and also in this case when faced with a political agenda of support for % israel ]
therefore while not defining it its scope of application is the same as set out in & article eighty three ] of the association agreement
outstanding issues regarding the & agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance between israel and the eu ]
the commission is presently working on a modification of the system including the publication of a list of settlement codes which will increase awareness of % eu ] importers and will allow customs authorities to verify these declarations more effectively
of course the commission could also use existing means under the association agreement to ensure that % israel ] implements the & acaa ] turning to the @ two thousand and five ] technical arrangement which allows the % eu ] to identify and deny preferential treatment under the association agreement to goods produced in areas beyond % israel ] 's @ pre one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven ] borders it must be recalled that preferential treatment in terms of customs tariffs is an entirely different issue to conformity assessment and that the origin of the product fully keeps its relevance when the certified product is to enter the territory of the % eu ]
its objective is to eliminate barriers to trade through allowing products covered by the agreement to enter the markets of the parties without additional conformity assessment procedures resulting in mutual recognition of conformity assessment and inspection results which will reduce costs and time for economic operators
for practical reasons and for reasons of compliance with ` wto ] 's non discrimination rules these agreements cannot discriminate or exclude on the basis of origin
there have been cases of abuse which have been detected and tackled appropriately but they are few and insignificant in volume of trade
according to information received from ) israeli ] authorities and ngos there is currently no pharmaceutical production in ) israeli ] settlements
as it results from international obligations of the % eu ] and as confirmed by the ` european court of justice ] in two @ thousand and ten ] in the ` brita ] case the % eu ] does not recognise ) israeli ] jurisdiction over the territories placed under ) israeli ] administration after
mr president i also thank commissioner } de gucht ] for his very clear answers though they only confirmed what we already knew
it is time to get on and vote on this agreement
@ two years ] of discussion in committee has been a delaying tactic as commissioner } de gucht ] said the objective of the & acaa ] is to eliminate barriers to trade by reducing costs and delays
you are doing consumers and patients no favours on choice and price of medicines
i hope that if there are ) palestinian ] pharmaceutical products they will also benefit from easier export to the % eu ] under this protocol
on the question of trade and human rights i have no hesitation whatsoever in criticising settlements or administrative detention by % israel ] or the many human rights breaches by the ! two ] ) palestinian ] administrations
trade is not at the expense of human rights
i have to say as vice chair of the ) us ] delegation that has never stopped me criticising human rights problems like rendition in $ guantnamo ] in the % united states ] and it will not stop me on % israel ] either
namely it is about trying to impose our political views on % israel ] through trade leverages
this did not work in the past and will definitely not work in the future
contrary to what colleagues have been saying @ today ] it is not the greatest democracy in the * middle east ]
on the other hand i think the political stance of the % european union ] with respect to % israel ] is clear we do not recognise the settlements we have to apply the existing legislation with respect to the settlements in the way that has been voted upon and the same goes for possible additional legislation
what i have been doing is giving you the assurances that in good faith i can give you
let us be coherent about how we tackle the suffering in the * occupied territories ] and the increased trade benefits we give to % israel ]
more trade and easier trade should never be at the expense of upholding our commitments to human rights
the collective punishment of % gaza ] is unacceptable and until serious steps are taken by % israel ] to comply with international law i strongly oppose this upgrade i hope that the commission is able to give detailed answers on how the caa would function in practice and how we would ensure that products manufactured in the settlements do not fall under the scope of the protocol
& acaa ] is a purely technical agreement and has become a highly politicised one as part of an % israel ] bashing exercise which does nothing to facilitate access to high quality and affordable pharmaceutical products for our ) european ] consumers
how much better to recognise that here is a country of nearly ! eight million ] people with a standard of living higher than many % eu ] member states
how much the ) palestinians ] could learn and benefit from this if they were given the opportunity by their own leaders if they recognised the right of % israel ] to exist ended terrorism and hostility and moved forward in a positive spirit with negotiation of a ! two ] state solution
those seeking to pick holes in the & eu israel caa protocol ] should ask themselves a simple question do we want to bring about peace and prosperity for ) palestinians ] or do we wish to condemn another generation to a life of poverty hardship and insecurity
on the one hand we have the legal issues
does the commission consider that it has the legal authority to reject or geographically restrict the territorial scope of the agreement
but at the same time as the commission provides the legal clarifications i have to ask myself irrespective of the legal arguments is it coherent or credible for the % eu ] to consistently and forcefully criticise the ) israeli ] authorities
many patients in the % eu ] do not have access to proper treatment for diseases especially those suffering from rare diseases
every tonne of co two that is emitted @ today ] will remain in the atmosphere for over @ a hundred years ]
we can have a green economy
a strong vote from this ` parliament ] tomorrow will send a message to businesses to farmers to industry to consumers and to voters and the young people of * europe ] that we are serious about climate change it is a compromise sure but it is one that we have to make and the political groups here are committed to it
the damage continues to be done to the whole planet
the task before us goes beyond the choices that individuals privately make this is about industries and it is about governments making the right choices and taking concrete measures this is our moment for action
we pushed for more compliance checks yes
we know today that climate change is affecting every country in every continent
this ` parliament ] must have a progressive and ambitious stand on these measures closing loopholes and making sure that member states reduce their emissions
we need to end once and for all the free ride that polluters have been given this is not a technical debate but i believe that this is a human rights debate because our citizens and our children have a right to a cleaner world
unlike the commissioner we know that this can be done and we want to be ambitious and we want to have something that really works
this is our opportunity to really show that we are ready to stand up to the occasion
i am proud that this political group was part of a group that stopped the attempts to water down this legislation
we believe that we have the means to stop this devastation but we need to have the political will to do so
it is no longer time for watering down legislation because we can make a positive impact
this is what we worked hard to achieve in the effort sharing regulation
as ) socialists ] and ) democrats ] we believe that it is our duty to respond properly to our planet 's greatest challenge with determination and honesty
there are no excuses our economy will die if our ecosystems collapse
we had the opportunity to make serious policies with the emissions trading scheme and this is our opportunity now with this regulation
ensuring also that all sectors contribute to a proper reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
i would say to the commissioner that we need to think now if we want to ensure our future and we need to have a long term perspective
@ two thousand and fifty ] the % eu ] 's climate and energy policies keep perpetuating the same misguided path continuing to be the solo leader in the futile battle against climate change whereas the % usa ] and others are acting in favour of progress and prosperity
my party and i oppose the % eu ] climate and energy policy
the aim of this proposal is to deliver in the relevant sectors ! thirty ] emissions reductions by @ two thousand and thirty ] compared to @ two thousand and five ] levels
once again we are expanding and strengthening its remit
however in this instance the project is one of the biggest threats to ) european ] industry and competitiveness
this time the ` european commission ] proposal climate action regulation implementing the & paris agreement ] covers all sectors that currently fall outside the % eu ] emission trading system with particular regard to transport waste environment and agriculture
consistent with these goals the & paris agreement ] also requires that ! zero ] net emissions must be achieved in the @ second half of this century ]
in the % uk ] we would say that this amounted to flogging a dead horse
the sole effect that this huge burden of climate regulation is going to have is to exacerbate the crisis already being experienced by % european union ] industries that are forced to move offshore taking their emissions and their jobs with them
we improved the commission 's proposal
i very much regret this because he really put a lot of effort into this file and it is a pity that he cannot be here our thoughts are certainly with him ~ secondly ] i would like to say that it is a bit strange that @ tomorrow ] we are going to discuss } trump ] withdrawing from the & paris agreement ] and @ today ] we are going to discuss our own actions i can tell you that the ) greens ] tried to link those ! two ] discussions
we are creating loopholes loopholes in the legislation so that this ! minus forty ] is not even really minus
that is really my main criticism too in this ` parliament ]
the commission 's proposal had too many loopholes
we are doing a lot of work on climatesmart agriculture but there is only so far we can go
! one seven billion ] in terms of purchasing carbon
we know that we have to do more but what i would ask colleagues to understand is the situation where we do not have heavy industry we have a large agricultural sector and we need much more flexibility on this issue because farmers are concerned that the cost of this at the moment if we look at the calculations would be over eur
i know commissioner that you are fully familiar with our problems in % ireland ] because we have a strong and large agricultural sector
we have a lot of political imbalances we have a lot of environmental imbalances and we have a lot of economic imbalances and they all act together
interconnected
we must recognise the specific situation of the farming sector and ensure that they can continue to produce but protect at the same time
even though we know that many % us ] states cities and businesses are continuing or even scaling up climate action and green investment
as a result of this work ` alde ] the ` epp ] and ` ecr ] groups agreed to table a set of joint amendments that will do ! three ] things ~ firstly ] maintain the strength and emissions trajectory adopted by the ` envi committee ]
at the same time we must maintain a strong driver for energy efficient and clean transport
i applaud that the groups here in the ` european parliament ] have decided to unanimously give a strong signal to the international community that it will support this report in plenary @ tomorrow ]
~ secondly ] it will increase the optional use of forest credits from ! one hundred and nineteen million ] to < two hundred and eighty million tons ] which will help build the business case for forest based climate measures
mr president the most powerful signal that the ` european parliament ] can give is that it is serious about tackling climate change and is taking real action implementing the & paris agreement ] by passing the climate action regulation @ tomorrow ]
but thankfully % china ] has restated their strong commitment to the & paris agreement ] and president } macron ] has announced that % france ] will do more compared to earlier commitments
it deals with almost ! two thirds ] of all greenhouse gases emitted across the % eu ]
so with or without } trump ] climate action and green investment under the & paris agreement ] must move ahead
~ thirdly ] we will give better support to lowerincome member states that have reduced their emissions significantly in @ earlier years ]
in the long term our forests are crucial to build the zero carbon economy
farming is also covered in this regulation and we will include special support for climateefficient farmers
the compromises reached will represent a balance between delivering on the % eu ] 's commitments on the one hand and providing fairness for all member states and regulating the regulated sectors on the other
however last week president } trump ] announced that he would withdraw the % united states ] from the & paris climate change agreement ]
this is sending a dreadful signal to the rest of the world
mr president i am sceptical in many ways towards the % european union ] but on this i think it is a challenge that we should meet
there can be benefits if we meet this challenge there can be benefits in producing our proteins locally rather than bringing them < thousands of kilometres ] across an ocean
there can be benefits in recycling the animal manure and reusing the energy and the fertiliser saving on heavy use of energy in chemical fertilisers
there can be use in reusing water
this can all bring benefits to the farming community and we need to sell it to people by showing that there will be financial benefits locally because if we produce locally people can stay locally and everyone is happy and the planet benefits
in particular the commission will now proceed with the codification of the regulations concerned by the adoption of the ! two ] omnibus packages
let me assure you that the commission has acted as expediently as possible in order to reach this point it would also be fair to say that with the adoption of both regulations the % eu ] trade policy framework is undergoing another major shift
while streamlining our decision making processes we will be able to act in a more timely manner gaining further credibility on the international stage
this is a major achievement
the text in front of you is fully in line with the outcome of the trilogue and is fully supported by the commission
we will also agree that a number of concessions have been needed on all sides in order to reach a compromise
as we all know arriving at this point in the legislative process has not been easy it has taken a long time
i would also like to confirm the declarations made by the commission as part of the trilogue
having the new procedures in place will allow us to act swiftly to implement the common commercial policy and assist % eu ] operators more efficiently
as agreed this process will be initiated by @ one june two thousand and fourteen ] at the latest further improving the legibility of the new legal framework for all stakeholders let me close by thanking again on behalf of commissioner } de gucht ] the rapporteurs and ` parliament ] as a whole for your engagement on this important file
with the & lisbon treaty ] and the rules governing implementing powers in place we have managed to find a new institutional balance that will govern the adoption of implementing and delegated acts in the area of trade policy
finally let me conclude by stressing our appreciation for the sense of urgency that the ` european parliament ] attached to these ! two ] files especially now in times of intense legislative activity
by adopting these ! two ] regulations the ` european commission ] looks forward to implementing the new rules in @ early two thousand and fourteen ] and to activating the decision making procedures and communication channels as established under the new framework
mr president without entering into much detail let me stress that by adopting this interinstitutional agreement the commission will now be able to react even more swiftly to defend ) european ] interests working at the same time and in strengthened cooperation and contribution with the institutional partners
with the new structure in place we will continue to monitor the functioning of the system in order to make it more effective and intelligible for our citizens
it is true that % turkey ] has made progress recently in the field of women 's rights
i feel that the ) turkish ] government could take further action in order to prevent early forced marriages as well as taking more action on the more recent issues of honour suicides or honour killings
mr president in this age of austerity when governments across the world and across the % eu ] are having to tighten their belts and cut spending it is important that we come up with initiatives for growth and give confidence to our electorate that we are seeking ways for growth to create jobs
indeed it asserts that instead of harmonising criminal law across the % eu ] it may be more prudent to improve mutual recognition
it is much more experienced and thus better equipped to tackle crime in the % uk ] and beyond
mr president the report recognises that criminal law is a highly sensitive policy area and many member states feel that their own individual criminal justice systems should continue to serve them best
this is particularly relevant for my member state the % uk ] where the criminal justice system dates back nearly @ one hundred and forty years ]
i backed this report and i welcome the paragraphs that call for a better exchange of best practice between member states and an improvement in cooperation between the commission and the member states as i feel that this can only lead to a smoother functioning of the single market which is after all the greatest prize of % eu ] membership
@ this year ] we celebrate the ! twenty ] anniversary of the adoption of the & single market act ] and the organisation of the # single market forum ]
although we have come a long way it is still of vital importance that the legislation that is in place for businesses as well as consumers is effective
mr president i cautiously welcome the report on the @ two thousand and twenty ] perspective for women in % turkey ] as it recognises the progress that % turkey ] has made in women 's rights and it also highlights the continued work that needs to be carried out from now on
given that % turkey ] is a candidate country to join the % eu ] it is even more important for it to meet the copenhagen criteria before % eu ] membership is achieved
it is disturbing to learn that ! thirty nine ] of ) turkish ] women have apparently encountered some form of physical violence during their adult lives
despite the progress that has been made violence against women continues and so further efforts need to be made
i therefore support the ) turkish ] government and call on it to adopt a ! zero ] tolerance policy towards violence against women
it is encouraging to hear that % turkey ] has newly appointed a minister for family and social policies who has stated that women 's rights and gender equality will be ! one ] of the government 's priorities
we need to follow it up vigorously
i especially welcome paragraph ! eleven ] which calls on the ) turkish ] government to investigate the phenomenon of honour suicides
i welcome that paragraph ! eleven ] for example calls for further research on this
i voted against paragraph
it is important to continue to highlight areas that need greater attention to ensure that all % eu ] citizens can benefit from the single market
it is of concern that only ! eleven ] member states have reached the ! one ] transposition deficit target that was set by the ` european council ] itself
mr president i voted in favour of this report on the internal market scoreboard as the scoreboard itself has proved to be a valuable tool in identifying key areas of improvement for member states with respect to the progress they are making in transposing internal market legislation
the single market is the most effective tool we have for restoring growth across the % eu ] in these current economically difficult times
mr president i voted in favour of this resolution because i believe that the % european union ] should use its influence to support the cause of women in % turkey ] and promote women 's rights in accordance with the & charter of european rights ]
the accession process is valuable in itself and we must assist accession countries in implementing laws which are consistent with our principles and values although i have to say that there are member states where few women are in politics and in high level decision making positions so we also have to work in our own member states
coming back to % turkey ] women are active members of their communities and must be involved in the decision making process in all areas
increased political participation for approximately ! half ] of the ) turkish ] population will only increase the country 's wealth and its democratic credentials
both in identifying % turkey ] 's progress and in detailing where more work needs to be done i welcome the tone of the report which is neither hectoring nor lecturing and identifies this as clearly a work in progress i particularly welcome progress in % turkey ] in the areas of health and education for women and children the appointment of a minister for family and social policies is a good sign and i have been very impressed by her strong public assurances that the ) turkish ] government is continuing to escalate the issue of women 's rights up its agenda
of course there is a long way to go but we should be encouraging the ) turkish ] government to continue on this trajectory
whilst we see increasing problems with cross border crime including people trafficking and cyber crime which both in their own special ways add to the total sum of human misery we must be careful to develop a very proportionate response
i am particularly keen on strengthening the international links and making sure that the communications between member states are improved
there should be no excuse for failure on the basis of lack of information however there is also much that i cannot support
mr president i welcome the report on strengthening the rights of vulnerable consumers as it will give those consumers an added degree of protection when purchasing goods and products across the % eu ]
the proposals put forward in the report are balanced and sensible particularly in relation to misleading advertising unfair contract terms and unfair business practices
this is always a consideration for my political group and most particularly for my national delegation of ) british conservatives ]
of course we should look at the implications of creating such % eu ] criminal law and the political and economic costs but we know from so much experience that looking at reviewing and developing an approach so very often turns into an overweening desire to legislate regulate and impose
i simply cannot support that whilst i see that many of the individual issues in this report are well crafted and thoughtful it simply does not outweigh my belief that each member state is best placed to make its own decisions
i felt that the report was an interesting one the approach was thoughtful and there were certain bits i could agree with
i strongly believe that corruption organised crime terrorism radicalisation cyber crime challenges to border management and illicit trafficking all represent major threats to the internal security of the % european union ] and to the lives of its citizens therefore concrete action must be taken by the relevant bodies in order not only to fight against these threats but also to prevent them
i support the application of the principle of mutual recognition in practice not so much to extend the scope of % eu ] harmonised law but rather to promote cooperation between judiciaries which must be equally reliable and share the same level of quality and integrity
i would like to make a comment following what i heard from my ) british ] colleagues in particular
we need a strategy to protect the rights of vulnerable customers
they look attractive on the surface but once these fraudulent companies get your credit card details you are wide open to fraud and exploitation
i think we need to look very closely in relation to how we protect our vulnerable consumers because this report is good it is good start but we have a long way to go
mr president i voted for this report on strengthening the rights of vulnerable consumers because i believe it is an important element of creating a single market in * europe ] which works for the benefit of all citizens and for ) european ] business
we are all vulnerable at some point in our lives although we may not always wish to acknowledge that particularly when we see ourselves in our prime however the development of the digital economy really does exacerbate this situation
we are all just ! one ] keystroke away from making a bad or a wrong decision as consumers and this can be far more difficult to rectify than such a decision made in a face to face transaction
this is particularly the case as has been mentioned for young people but let us not forget the older consumers who whilst they may be trying to welcome online business into their lives find it creates specific challenges
this own initiative report sets out a strategy for strengthening the rights of these people calling on the monitoring of behaviour and the development of specific protection proposals and i welcome it
i backed the report 's assertion that consumers ability to make the best decision by themselves is optimised in a situation in which they have access to all adequate information which is both comprehensible and easily accessible
mr president the report on the % eu ] internal security strategy makes a number of sensible recommendations for improving security within the % eu ] to ensure that our citizens are fully protected
i welcome suggestions to strengthen the % eu ] 's internal security strategy in relation to combating the rising threats of terrorism and cross border crime and those relating to natural and man made disasters
securing a good balance between research in support of policy and more basic research reinforcing social science in the work programmes promoting dissemination of results and encouraging more coordination between national research programmes
` kbbe ] and & theme six ] environment
the annual budget for ` fp seven ] will progressively increase during the @ last three years ] of the programme and both the fisheries and aquaculture sectors will certainly benefit from this increase the commission will pursue its effort to support research in line with the report by giving more visibility to fisheries and aquaculture research in ` fp seven ]
they in turn will also benefit from improved cooperation and coordination of national research through the different ` european research area ] initiatives and within the direction of the common fisheries policy
you have to be accountable to the people of * europe ] not to me
the best way to stand up for social rights is to make sure that people can with a job take care of their families and of their children
the & treaty of lisbon ] does not need to be repeated
let us see how concretely we can work with member states to make sure that we remove the obstacles that deprive citizens of jobs growth and competitiveness
and then you have an ideological position which says let us repeat ! a thousand ] times what is already in the text just to make the point that we stand for social rights
the best way to include the social dimension is to make sure that people have a job
i do not understand this position
the commission has identified breaches and is going to report to the ` council ] in @ october ] on loophole restrictions which have been identified striving to maximise the economic effects
too seldom are proportionality assessments carried out and i do suggest that the commission clarifies and provides guidance to member states on how to apply the proportionality test
the economic needs tests have to be lifted and unjustified requirements that shut down operators from other member states have to be removed
i welcome the great job that the commission has done and in particular the personal commitment of commissioner } barnier ] welcome commissioner to the policy of non tolerance
i do not see these as punitive measures
likewise i think we have to have a country specific recommendation in the european semester in the peer review and also linking to the implementation and full enforcement of the rules of the & services directive ]
is it acceptable to impose higher prices on non residents for rescue packages or for travel
with the service sector accounting for nearly ! seventy ] of % eu ] gdp and total employment it is a pillar of our economy progress has been made but much too slowly and there are still unjustified restrictions and barriers which hamper the movement of services is it for instance normal that nationality requirements and regional authorisations are still in place in some parts of the % eu ]
the question still is how many jobs are we losing on a daily basis because the internal market for services is not fully functioning
and growth in the whole ) european ] economy at a time when we are desperate to create more jobs it is quite clear that growing service businesses take on more people more quickly than any other segment of the economy that has been clearly demonstrated by economic analysis for many years
it is also clear that the purveyors of services themselves have an energising effect on economies there are many areas where we need more expertise in computer systems in marketing in the internet in designing and putting together buildings and in developing and building them these are all services where we need more active competition it was very interesting when i led the committee 's mission to % greece ] @ the other week ] you will be interested in this madam president that we heard from the trade unions about the lack of competition in the ) greek ] economy and how that was holding back the economy
we heard from the minister for competitiveness how he was setting about dealing with that and services were absolutely at the heart of his approach
this is something that applies everywhere colleagues and something we need to get to grips with
although we generally support the new ) greek ] government in breaking with the policies of its predecessors and we welcome its anti austerity programmes we think that there is now a very important opportunity for this new ) greek ] government to break with the past and revise their policies vis vis % macedonia ]
however we believe that the promise to continue the talks is not enough now
if they feel unable to do that they should step down and someone else should do it
we believe there is much to be built upon in ) macedonian ] politics but this building needs to be done right now
i commend the efforts of our ! three ] colleagues in bringing the ) macedonian ] political leaders to the negotiating table
the families i talked to had hidden for their lives from a @ thirty hour ] firefight and suffered the trauma of witnessing ! eighteen ] people dead
i have repeatedly warned that * europe ] 's failure to start accession talks risks a return to conflict and this deadly attack is a tragic and urgent reminder that this warning is crying out to be heard what happened in % kumanovo ] and in the country may not be the direct responsibility of * europe ] but if we expect the political parties of the country to exercise their responsibilities and we do expect that then they can reasonably expect * europe ] to exercise ours
~ fourthly ] the reforms in the very areas which have caused concern the judiciary the media electoral practices civil society have already been part of progress reports action plans and the high level accession dialogue so that any fresh commitment to address them must demonstrate why this time it will be different
we all hoped that this was a one off event with no repercussions for inter ethnic relations but the families told me they believe the event to be linked to the breakdown of political stability this lack of trust is in itself dangerous
it is like reviving ghosts of the past and this has to be investigated including the allegations that it might have been instigated also even by the } gruevski ] government or even with ) russian ] influence
! one ] last thing i would like to call on the ` european people 's party ] to stop defending politicians of their own political family who simply have drifted away from the democratic path and from the rule of law
it is also not an ethnic conflict which is important to say and i was very glad to see @ last sunday ] ) albanian ] and ) slavic macedonians ] demonstrating together peacefully in % skopje ] even uniting their flags
so this is an important signal that should take us further
message
from the outset of the political crisis the % european union ] has called for the restoration of normal political dialogue between the main government and opposition parties
let me now turn to the long term political crisis from which those events cannot be a distraction
we have already said that this is a concrete step towards political accountability and that we hope that this development will contribute to restoring faith in state institutions in this context we have also followed the ! two ] sets of demonstrations that were held in % skopje ] on @ sunday ] and @ monday ]
the commission has also sent a team of senior legal experts to look into some of the systemic issues on which the commission had previously expressed concern
in conclusion our collective approach to this crisis is a good example of how various % eu ] institutions and services can work together using our various tools to deliver a clear ) european ]
it is important that people were able to freely express their views on both occasions this was done in a peaceful manner a calm and appropriate handling from all sides will remain important
we call on the leaders of the country to take their responsibilities seriously and put the interests of the state above those of their parties in parallel the % european union ] has been calling on the relevant authorities to investigate all allegations of potential
in this difficult situation we should be clear and decisive in carrying our message of support
in a country with such severe challenges it is important that the democratic institutions and mechanism work
there are serious revelations coming from the wire tapping scandal which have to be addressed by the relevant authorities at the same time politicians need to address the question of political accountability
please let us keep in mind that the ) european ] integration processes are in this situation one of the few tools which could help to overcome this crisis
it is important that all politicians show responsibility and openness
i mean the politicians in % macedonia ] but also the politicians in this very house
this concerns especially the parliament which is the platform for a political dialogue and mechanism for political oversight
in this situation we have to see reflection political responsibility and more political dialogue
he described the violence and killings in the north and he referred to the long running political crisis in the country
from the % european union ] 's point of view what is important is that it brings another entry country into its great empire
the commissioner is confident that % fyrom ] can soon be brought back on track in its candidate process in joining the % european union ] indeed as recently as @ eleven march ] this ` parliament ] voted in favour of the progress report on % fyrom ] 's entry into the % eu ]
like so many countries before it it does not matter how corrupt or unsuitable % fyrom ] is
i am sure he understates the seriousness of the nature of the problem but never mind because he tells us that the % eu ] is sending legal experts to sort out the systematic problems there
however @ today ] we are facing a very deep political crisis and we should be aware that it is not just a momentous situation it is about very fundamental issues which are enshrined in the ) european ] idea
this is a very serious problem i was there on @ sunday ] at the civil rally which gathered in % skopje ]
as ! one ] of the speakers from the students movement said it is not about power but about how the state will be functioning and this should not be repeated
but my question is this is very much about regional cooperation about engagement and really practical things that might be changed because of bilateral and multilateral relations
you allowed ! one ] blue card ! two ] blue cards
a lot of them were not even questions
i came in here like my colleague over there in good faith i wanted to listen to the debate
that i will get to the airport and i will be safe
i invite you to have a look at for example the connectivity index
so this says what this report is aiming at and i believe that if we vote for it this is yet another important step in the right direction
well i am afraid that she cannot recall the deliberations because she did not have the time to join us for ! one ] single meeting otherwise she would know that the social aspects were present from the very beginning
i am rather in favour of reports that will outline exactly the tools the instruments with which we will manage to do it
a number of major airports in the % union ] and their respective state 's authorities has been approached and consulted in order to have such an arrangement in place
this issue is therefore worth exploring further
it has been estimated that many of the indirect co two emissions at airports originate from surface access transport
developing important public transport systems is therefore key both for environmental reasons and for fairer competition between airport modes and we are pursuing this goal
in recent years regional airports have begun to pursue commercial objectives and are competing with each other to attract air traffic
as a prerequisite such travellers need to enrol and a programme determines the level of risk posed by the individual
this needs a series of procedural and infrastructural modifications to the current configuration in place at union airports
each year around ( eur five billion ] are wasted because we have not been making progress with the & single european sky ]
in this regard the commission will launch @ this year ] a feasibility study for the creation of a single ) european ] upper airspace to see how that could contribute concretely to the efficiency of our skies
% eu ] aviation today represents ! twenty six ] of the world market it therefore deserves all our attention
these measures are expected in the spring and should include the following ~ first ] new guidelines on ownership and control rules to bring clarity and facilitate their application
the commission is committed to strengthening social dialogue in aviation
~ third ] a proposal to replace & regulation no eight hundred and sixty eight two thousand and four ] on unfair practices with more effective instruments our objective being to present a credible instrument that will allow us to act effectively when % eu ] air carriers are injured because of the discriminatory practices originating from ~ third ] countries
this will ensure a level playing field and equal treatment for all airlines flying in * europe ]
aviation is a global business and no country must be left behind
a lot of progress has been made so far and i am confident that we will conclude this file under the ) maltese ] presidency
on the environment issue following ` icao ] 's landmark agreement we are now focused on getting the global scheme up and running
this is closely linked to the importance of having fair competition
safety is our top priority and ` easa ] is continuously examining the safety aspects of emerging business models we will continue to closely monitor developments in the market and take action where necessary
furthermore the ` eu court of justice ] is expected @ this year ] to provide interpretation of these matters in particular as regards the home base of aircrews
i am pleased to note your support for our proposal on the revision of the aviation safety basic regulation and in particular that ` easa ] should be equipped with sufficient resources and staff
related to the competitiveness of the % eu ] aviation sector i take note of the emphasis you put on attracting foreign investment
the ` sectoral social dialogue committee on civil aviation ] offers opportunities for the aviation social partners and the commission to better assess and address together the social challenges of aviation moving on to safety let me be clear that the same safety standards apply to everyone regardless of their employment relationships
we are evaluating the concept of whether this notion of principal place of business is still fit for purpose
and last but not least guidelines for atm service continuity on the ~ third ] topic standards let me first say a few words on safety
social dialogue is essential
i look forward to a trialogue on this file which should have started @ this monday ] and i sincerely hope that a new date will be agreed without further delay
we are serious about achieving carbon neutral growth for aviation and we will provide technical and financial assistance to make it happen globally
on social issues let me now touch upon the social policy elements of your report
in its proposal adopted earlier this month the commission is proposing to continue with the current geographic scope of the % eu ] emissions trading systems for aviation covering flights between airports in the ) european ] economic area
we are currently working on new measures aimed to promote or safeguard regional and overall connectivity in * europe ] as announced in the aviation strategy
this is part of our ongoing evaluation of the air service regulation and this work should be completed @ next year ] as foreseen in the & aviation strategy ]
~ second ] new guidelines on public service obligation
we are talking about more than ! two million ] direct jobs and a direct contribution of ( eur one hundred and ten billion ] to the % eu ] economy
it is clear that we have our work cut out all actors both at national and ) european ] level so allow me to turn to the key points raised in your report ~ first ] regarding the internal market i fully support swift progress on the blocked aviation files
on foreign investment the commission welcomes your continued support and interest in the % eu ] level comprehensive aviation agreements in line with our commitments we will keep you fully informed at all stages of the negotiations
i fully agree with your call for completing the % eu ] single market for aviation
aviation is the most highly regulated form of transport it is held to the most stringent legal safety standards with contracts of both pilots and crew having to be compliant with & easa eu ops ] and flight time limitations
! fifty four ] unbelievably their text infers that professional pilots on ) european ] airlines are employed on illegal bogus contracts thereby putting passengers in danger
to conclude this sends out the wrong signals for this committee
to make matters worse we have been unable to amend the contribution by the ` employment committee ]
why should they book flights
i hope this message has got through commissioner namely that we have to be very careful when we allow other committees to have so much input on certain dossiers
an opinion would have been quite sufficient
therefore i am not prepared to appease this ill thought through element of the report which has been included and which we have been unable to change but i thank again for the hard work and i know he understands this position
this was incorrect
to suggest it is not safe for ) european ] citizens to fly on ) european ] carriers is quite disgraceful
therefore these accusations are misleading provocative and have no foundation
we have already made numerous references to good working conditions high skill jobs and training throughout the report not least because all of us here support good jobs and good contracts of employment
none of their references are evidence based and in addition comments regarding business models such as home base criteria also have no place in this report showing breathtaking ignorance as ! seventy ] of flights across * europe ] come under general aviation
this is to a certain extent the purpose of this report to try to find some practical alternatives for what is not working today and to make some proposals for the future
competition is an opportunity for our airlines
this is of course very welcome and we have already started working on some of it but at the same time we still are still awaiting some of the proposals the aviation sector undoubtedly requires heavy investment in a fast evolving environment
~ first ] of all develop a connectivity index based on added value of all modes of transport in order to rationalise investment and improve the overall resilience of the transport network in * europe ] while improving connectivity this index can help policymakers to take the appropriate decisions without undermining territorial cohesion
competition with ~ third ] countries digitalisation it is now more than @ a year ago ] that the commission came with its plan to address these and some other challenges
i promised that i would make it clear to the commission that this completely means that we are putting an % eu ] stamp on a part of the airspace and saying that in this airspace the % eu ] should have priority over national flights
if we want to be efficient then we need to set a clear vision for this sector for the investments we make @ today ] and in the future we need to have a vision for the next even i would say @ fifty years ]
that is why the commission is invited to consider the creation of an % eu ] pre check system where passengers could voluntarily register in order to go through smooth security checks once at the airport
this is only going to be detrimental to passengers
i am afraid i cannot list all of them @ today ] but at least allow me to make a few points
on the contrary this is only about recalling some obligations that we should have towards the % european union ]
we also have the challenges of environmental targets and of course the files that are still sitting have not been resolved single ) european ] sky slot regulation passenger rights
congestion is going to be a difficulty
as we look back over @ the last twenty thirty years ] and look at the benefits of liberalisation and single skies in our airspace and what that has meant for businesses for jobs for tourism connecting people regions and cities that was bold that was ambitious and that has led to the growth of low cost airlines connecting people across * europe ] now we need the next tranche the next wave of ambition the aviation agreements are urgent and they need to progress and i think this was outlined clearly in the committee 's report * europe ] is important in terms of aviation but that importance is slipping and we now see growth in the * middle east ] * asia ] and the * pacific ] area
so the aviation air agreements we have seen are urgent are important
we know well the benefits of external aviation agreements
i mean look at % morocco ] at the way activity has doubled the ) balkan ] states doubled similarly with % canada ] and the % us ]
so we need to facilitate our ) european ] airlines and the aviation sector to tap into the growth potential of the fast growing external markets
we know that by @ two thousand and thirty five ] ! two million ] flights will be lost due to airport capacity shortage in our airports
we also need to look at ourselves and recognise that there are difficulties
commissioner this is a time when ) european ] aviation is a success it has been a success and it can be a success again if we equip our aviation sector to deal with the challenges that it faces today
the strategy on aviation is really a very one sided approach looking only at the problems of unfair competition internationally and of course some issues we have in the ) european ] airspace the rapporteur unfortunately did not take the integral approach that is needed for the aviation sector
however on the environmental side it hardly does anything it does not even mention the & paris agreement ]
mr president the continuing success of our aviation sector is very important for ) europeans ] as travellers and also as workers
i very much welcome the excellent work done by many mep colleagues in producing our views on an overarching aviation strategy
this work has included engaging constructively with the commission 's focus on a forward looking framework for regulation of the sector on the basis of a common ) european ] vision
making the single european sky a reality regardless of national demarcations would benefit all of us
i and many others will be doing everything we can to ensure that the % uk ] plays a full part in this project in the @ years to come ]
on the details of this report i believe that we as meps have a duty to promote the reduction and minimisation of environmental damage done by aviation and to encourage a shift to other more sustainable forms of transport where appropriate
it is fair to say the report could possibly have done more in this respect but i still think we should support it
however it is extremely welcome that we are voting @ today ] in support of calls to protect the rights of workers throughout the sector
i am not the right person to ask about meteorology or ocean currents or the @ medieval warm period ] or sunspots absolutely leave that to the experts
all support large human populations
the particular issue is how much we spend on seeking very slightly to mitigate the rise in temperatures with huge sums of money versus adapting with a fractional sum of money
i look around the world and i see that in % helsinki ] the mean temperature is about < five degrees ] in % athens ] it is about < twenty one degrees ] in % rio ] about < thirty five degrees ]
of course that is true but it works both ways around
i think we might just be able to adapt
how we then deal with that is a political rather than a scientific question
but i am an elected legislator and it seems to me that the question of how we respond proportionately and how we maximise our resources in dealing with the issue is the proper business of those of us who are answerable to constituents rather than of specialists in the field of climatology
it is to make the directors of the bank personally liable
you know it is a funny thing but if you start taxing countries for doing the right thing in order to pay countries for doing the wrong thing you are going to end up with fewer of the former and more of the latter
! one seven billion ] that has been levied on us in a surcharge for prosperity is what we got for having kept the pound
they would then have more incentive than anybody to prevent a meltdown which would leave them with nothing except personal debt
when the euro was being launched there was a mechanism to sanction countries that breached the & stability pact ] and thereby played some part in triggering the financial crisis it was never used % france ] and % germany ] were among the infracting states it was never triggered and yet we have in practice a fine against those countries which performed better than expected including the % uk ] because we did not join the single currency
@ two thousand and twenty ] it is essential that # lima ] sets us on the right track for ambitious actions necessary to combat the devastating effects of climate change which are already being seen in some developing countries
we currently have a feeble and weak kneed climate policy which is seriously risking the planet 's ability to halt dangerous levels of global warming there are countless reasons for more ambitious climate change strategy both from * europe ] and globally such as green jobs mitigating climate change a sustainable economy and energy independence and i hope that governments involved in # lima ] listen to the irrefutable scientific evidence and take decisive climate action now for today 's citizens and tomorrow 's generation
citizens from both the developed and the developing world need governments to aim higher and act faster
so while the precise consequences may differ from region to region and country to country we are all affected
% west midlands ] is also facing an increased risk of water shortages and lower agricultural productivity
this will be crucial for paving the way towards an ambitious and legally binding international agreement for climate action to be agreed in % paris ] @ next year ]
that is why i voted in favour of the motion for the resolution on the # two thousand and fourteen climate change conference ]
my friends unless we get the diagnosis right we will never get the prescription right
much more seriously we are deceiving ourselves
the worse of it is that the lies are continuing even now in this chamber we are assured over and over again that the debt crisis had nothing to do with the euro and that the economic crisis is unrelated to monetary union
we used to think it a characteristic of totalitarian regimes but what a wonderful description it is of the whole lamentable euro project also
the new president of the commission mr } juncker ] stood in front of us at a recent session and said that the euro had been a shelter in the economic storm
the thing was built on a fraud in the ~ first ] place as countries falsified their statistics in order to qualify and it was then sold to the people in an act of even greater fraud as we were told that it would add ! one ] to the gdp of all participating states every year in perpetuity
we are not only deceiving our constituents
it was the gap between what is said and what is
that was very evident as a result of the ` troika ] imposed austerity measures that have resulted in mass emigration and increased levels of poverty
that the ` ecb ] has now put on the record that it also intends to disregard an elected ` parliament ] of a member state is simply unacceptable
reading the title of this report the power of the ` ecb ] to impose sanctions i could not help but wonder who has the power to impose sanctions on the ` ecb ]
because the ` ecb ] 's role in exacerbating the ) irish ] financial and banking crisis and its failure now to even engage in a parliamentary inquiry into those events is unacceptable and should be challenged by members of this house
indeed i believe that the call for publishing sanctions only when all legal means of appeal against such a decision have been exhausted means that the door will be open for indefinite periods of stalling during which the ` ecb ] cannot publish the fact that it has to impose sanctions on particular banks
we should avoid repeating the bottlenecks we had in the past it is also important that markets know when banks have transgressed and that sanctions have been put on them as soon as possible
madam president i voted in favour of the } gualtieri ] report and would like to congratulate the rapporteur because it is vital that we have clear rules that are adopted on the ` ecb ] 's ability to circulate statistical information among the ) european ] system of central banks and to relevant member states and national institutions i also believe it is crucial
that regional variations are included in the statistics that are taken on board by the ` ecb ]
it is crucial also that organisations on the receiving end should take all the necessary regulatory technical administrative and organisational measures to ensure the physical and logical protection of confidential statistical information
i welcome the inclusion in the report of a call for increased transparency on the exemption of reporting agents and protection of confidential data used by the ` ecb ] under its new supervisory task
related to the sectoral support in the new protocol
this agreement aims to ensure the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries stocks we also want to prevent and combat illegal fishing and promote the development of port infrastructures and the protection of the marine environment through this agreement fishing opportunities have been reduced and the fees to be paid by ship owners
moreover with the aim of addressing all these deficiencies a new mechanism a trust account the cas was introduced as a temporary measure
we are trying to ensure appropriate information of the conservation and management measures pursuant to that regulation
time we hope that the ` council ] will adopt this new mandate next
the cas will become operational during the ~ first ] semester
regarding sectoral support the execution rate was very high in @ two thousand ]
this is what we
lastly investments by the % eu ] fishing sector are made in line with the % mauritania ] action
i agree with mrs } fraga ] on this matter the agreement with % mauritania ] has become the most important in financial terms it is the most important of our agreements given this development the commission is considering the introduction of a strong element of conditionality
this will happen through inter alia the decoupling of the access rights payments and the payments for sectoral support we are going to decouple
we cannot overfish these waters just pay sweep up the last fish and then go
i would also like to remind you that we have a new framework agreement between the commission and the ` parliament ] on the details of this involvement
in the margins of this framework agreement i am here to facilitate your involvement and your information in any way i can
if we can do things better i am here to cooperate
we also have to keep another balance we have to be very cautious about the spending of our taxpayers money
i recognise that we have to do more in order to ensure that the money we give goes into the hands of the real beneficiaries
they also have a great influence
so this is how we are approaching this very sensitive issue
it is immoral of any government to tax people to give aid
i come from a country which has suffered very badly from the economic problems started in
why is it that we are taxing widows and old people in my country in order to give foreign aid in many cases in very ill thought out situations
the commission is cautious however about ! two ] recommendations in the report to establish an intergovernmental body for tax cooperation and to establish a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring
good policies trade innovation policies and other non financial resources will be just as crucial
i have taken careful note of these including member 's calls for increased attention to private sector investments domestic revenue mobilisation monitoring and transparency of the commission 's own aid programmes and attention to the ` court of auditors ] reports on blending this report will reinforce the % european union ] 's determination to call for and contribute to achieving a comprehensive global package comprising aid investment and domestic resources together with an enhancing framework of good policies and good governance
the ! zero seven ] target with the timetable to be set during the negotiation process
impact we particularly welcome the emphasis in the report on the mobilisation and effective use of all forms of finance including domestic resources private investment blending and innovative financial sources
mr president i would like to thank the ` committee on development ] its chair ms } linda mcavan ] and the rapporteur mr } silva pereira ] for their dedicated work and for the openness of the consultations during the preparation of this report which the commission welcomes it comes at a critical juncture in the @ post two thousand and fifteen ] negotiations and will make a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate in the ` council ] which is expected to adopt conclusions @ next week ] it is encouraging to see that the views of ` parliament ] and the commission are generally well aligned on the issues of financing for development we share a vision of a global partnership to eradicate poverty share prosperity and foster sustainable development while defending human rights promoting gender equality and social cohesion and reducing inequalities
but we should be cautious about artificially dividing financing for climate and other development related activities
` imf ] the report contains many other interesting ideas and suggestions which we will take carefully into account in finalising the % eu ] position ahead of the % addis ] and % new york ] conferences
all while i believe it is right that we also have expectations of others we must be ready to play our full part by presenting our clear political commitment to
oda i also support the emphasis in the report on aid effectiveness and the need to ensure a higher degree of coordination between different aid mechanisms and donors
i believe we share the same objective to ensure that the global agreement on financing for development includes ambitious and credible commitments from
to implement such a far reaching agenda we need to consider the full range of means of implementation
the report is very rich covering a broad range of issues and making a number of requests to the commission
some climate change interventions for instance will meet the oda definition it is therefore important that synergies across various sustainable development objectives can be maximised to ensure that available resources can deliver the maximum
as i have said to ` parliament ] before the commission will help encourage member states to reach an agreement on an ambitious package of measures for the implementation of the sustainable development agenda including on the oda commitment however the decision on the timetable for reaching the ! zero ] ! seven ] target is ultimately a decision for the member states therefore when it comes to the @ two thousand and twenty ] timetable proposed in the report we need to consider carefully the political and economic realities within our member states the commission position has been that all developed countries should commit to
mobilising more finance from all sources public and private to tackle climate change is of course a priority
i welcome the clear support that the report expresses for an ambitious recommitment by the % european union ] to the
we are in favour of further discussions and analyses on these complex issues through an inclusive and participatory dialogue
the debate in our view should focus more on the substance rather than on the form and format of the statutory mechanisms of a multilateral legal framework
we should be careful not to divert this process into a bureaucratic nightmare but to reach an agreement on development policy that is comprehensive and clear can be easily monitored and is also in line with other international framework agreements such as the one on climate change
remove the common fisheries policies from their shores and allow them to sell their goods at a rate that suits them
some of the countries are still as poor as they were @ twenty years ]
ago i ask this institution to remove the barriers it has placed on these countries
increase the trade decrease the aid and you will see that poorer countries will start to flourish
it is in this way that we should be able to claim that the % european union ] is not only the biggest player in global development cooperation but also the best the most effective player
oda by using it in a more catalytic manner to engage and leverage other financial and non financial means of implementation that would suffice to cover such a demanding new sdg agenda
i believe the oda commitment matters it is important for our own development credibility as well as for the success of the international conferences in % addis ababa ] % new york ] and % paris ] @ this year ]
a number of important points have been raised here @ today ] and i have taken good note of them
as confirmed by the commission in our @ february ] communication the commission is of the opinion that the % european union ] should maintain its collective commitment to achieving the
at the same time we must recognise that oda alone will not be nearly enough to finance such a far reaching broad new global development agenda therefore we must envisage a new more strategic and functional additional role for
i think that above all @ today ] 's debate has underlined that both the commission and ` parliament ] share a firm desire to ensure that the % european union ] plays a leading role in supporting the adoption and implementation of a truly transformative @ post two thousand and fifteen ] agenda by raising the global level of ambition
the % uk ] i think has been exemplary also in looking for results and measuring those results i do not personally always agree with their approach of value for money how many vaccinations how many school books have been delivered but they are really looking at those results
we have started to create a ) european ] system
by unifying the work of national prosecutors under the new ` european public prosecutor 's office ] which will be leading the work of ) european ] delegated prosecutors they will be able to perform investigations in a cooperative manner using the common procedures and remaining in line with national laws
the ` european public prosecutor 's office ] is being introduced through enhanced cooperation but in this case it will affect the % united kingdom ] because that office will have the power to issue ) european ] arrest warrants and consequently the power to detain ) british ] citizens living in the % uk ]
i therefore voted against this resolution and i note that it is yet another situation where those who support % european union ] membership in the % united kingdom ] have been less than forthcoming about the true nature of the % eu ] project
i believe fundamentally in rehabilitation
and fundamentally that they get a job to go to so they can break the cycle of reoffending when they come out if we do all of those things then yes of course society should invest in helping prisoners to rehabilitate
of course crime crosses borders and for many years democratic nation states have collaborated without supranational institutions
this is about the creation of a federal legal system and a federal prosecution service giving the % european union ] the ultimate attribute of statehood namely the ability to use coercive force against its own citizens
yes sure starting with questions like fraud against the % eu ] budget and racketeering is just the way the ` fbi ] and the federal prosecutors started in the % united states ]
we absolutely believe in cooperation in the field of crime and policing
after the % united kingdom ] has left you will be able to rely on our continued collaboration but this is exactly why we are leaving
these experiences have led me to vote against this report not because of its good intentions but because it does not adequately address the most urgent issue facing prisons across * europe ] as well as in % norwich bedford chelmsford ] and in the other prisons across my region that is the rise of radical and violent ideologies and terrorist radicalisation
if they can show that it does not add value then we have no argument but i think they will find that very difficult to do the ~ second ] point i want to make is that the ~ second ] part of our discussion > this morning ] is on own resources
i would like to compliment the countries who have introduced the & ftt ] on their enhanced cooperation hopefully it will prove successful so that all countries will join in eventually
that is clear
this is very clear we have to be aware that the procedure for the next multiannual financial framework is taking place in a very difficult context
budget we have the traditional policies here but we have to make sure that for the @ next seven years ] the ) european ] budget stimulates growth the creation of growth and the creation of jobs across
the ~ first ] is the size of the budget
times this is an investment budget
we have to be clear when we speak about the size of the budget
{ ninety four per cent ] of the budget goes back to the member states and it attracts several times more investment
i must begin by saying that the commission 's proposal is not sufficient to finance all the political ambitions that the % european union ] has set
level furthermore the ) european ] budget does what national budgets cannot do in these difficult
madam president this house is stretching the meaning of the word investment beyond elasticity
employment comes from new industry and new industry requires capital flexibility and less red tape none of which the % european union ] helps with
can any mep claim that the ( many billion euros ] of taxpayers money spent on the lisbon agenda have delivered any return
however there are ! three ] points which i want to make ~ firstly ] on the question of the size of the budget it is important that we reflect the difficult times being experienced by the member state governments and for that reason we are calling for a freeze at ! one ] gni ~ secondly ] on the issue of own resources
finally i recognise the efforts which are being made towards resolving the crisis in the ) european ] economy however with resources strictly limited is it not time that we revaluated our spending priorities for the % european union ] budget
it is clear that we are going to have to take tough choices in the future and i want to stress to this house that those choices must be based on the target of achieving true ) european ] added value
we remain open to suggestions but we are not persuaded by the case either for a financial transaction tax or for value added tax ~ thirdly ] on the question of the rebate can i remind this house that this is simply a matter of mathematics and not one of sentiment emotion or politics
overall i think we should remember that spending is only one very small part of the picture how do we return to growth
where are the ` googles ] and the ` facebooks ] of * europe ]
let us ask the question how many large % eu ] companies which compete at the top level globally have been established in @ the last twenty years ]
we should focus on completing the single market promote entrepreneurs and make way for growth and prosperity
to continue with wasteful subsidies rather than focusing on the better use of existing resources
the ) european ] budget is about the multiannual predictability of investment in * europe ] with a shortage of investment money in the national budgets
budgetary deficits of some member states
transparent and simple response to everybody who wants a simple transparent and a fair system of own resources
but we need to be fully aware that there are both legal and political obstacles in some member states which otherwise would like to participate in the ftt enhanced cooperation
of course we all work on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed
we just raised issues and questions for consideration
to their gni contribution
in my own member state welfare benefits are being cut health and education spending is frozen and wages are frozen or declining
we support a more flexible budget allowing ` parliament ] to switch spending in year and most importantly allowing end year under spends to be rolled over into the next financial year instead of being handed back to member states
it is therefore impossible to justify any significant increase in the % eu ] budget
every transport minister i meet wants help from the % eu ] to build up a ) european ] added value transport infrastructure from within their member states but clearly there is often a breakdown of communication between the transport ministers and the finance ministers
~ firstly ] the need to stimulate growth and jobs is the cornerstone of the % eu ] 's recovery plan and its @ two thousand and twenty ] vision and transport and the provision of much needed infrastructure can be crucial in delivering jobs and growth as part of those plans
~ secondly ] we welcome the commission 's proposal on the connecting europe facility as providing an effective tool in delivering cross border transport infrastructure that is both sustainable and achievable
we must ensure that every euro spent brings ) european ] added value and that particular attention is given under the future mff to the quality of spending
@ over the last few years ] the % european union ] and its member states have taken important steps in response to the challenges raised by the economic and financial crisis
at the same time we are all aware of the constraints under which we are working
i would like to take this opportunity to thank you personally mr president for your personal involvement and assistance and most of all your strong commitment to providing the % european union ] with the most important instrument in our hands for living up
i wish to thank both of them for their work on this report
the ` council ] attaches the highest importance to the timely conclusion of this agreement
on which you will be voting later
at a time of exceptional fiscal discipline it is essential that the future mff reflects the consolidation efforts being made by member states to bring their deficits and debt onto a more sustainable path
to our ambitions for growth and jobs for the young generation in order for all of us to honour the contract between generations
looking to the future the next mff must ensure that the % european union ] 's budget is geared to lifting * europe ] out of the crisis in a sustainable way
following the award of the ? nobel prize ] to the % european union ] we must more than ever show ) european ] citizens that we are able to unite around a fundamental part of the ) european ] project by doing everything to make the % european union ] more relevant to prove that the % european union ] is part of the solution and to offer to each
your contribution through your representatives on that occasion was highly appreciated
it contains a number of important points which we will bring to the attention of member states
as you know the ` general affairs council ] is the place where the discussions on the mff are taking place
they are not meant to penalise the member states or regions that need financial support most urgently but rather to ensure that precious capital will actually help address the very deficiencies identified in country specific recommendations
we would like to increase the efficiency effectiveness and simplification of their delivery
i would say in particular that the informal exchange of views before the last ` general affairs council ] was very important in this respect
madam president i believe that increasingly the ` european parliament ] must be the ` european parliament ] not a collection of parliaments of member states
that is why this interim report and i commend my colleagues } bge ] and } kalfin ] actually reflects a hugely ) european ] dimension to the budget
for too long we have had debates about those who pay and those who benefit
this is not the way we should talk in terms of a % european union ] budget
yes we have to acknowledge difficulties in member states but we must insist that the budget of the % european union ] is for ) european ] citizens for growth and for jobs
the chairman of the ` agriculture committee ] has reflected very well the view of that committee but can i also stress to colleagues that we are asking for this money to facilitate more farmers in the % european union ]
we have heard the arguments of colleagues from the new member states who rightly and justifiably feel that they are badly treated because of the differences in payments so we must acknowledge that this report is a ) european ] report
~ second ] the budget has to be highly targeted
we cannot tackle the crisis without the means needed to fuel growth in * europe ]
we cannot meet our pledge for more * europe ] without a budget commensurate with our ambitions and now a little institutional twist
we have to realise these ambitions with ! one ] budget with ! one ] unified budget in order to safeguard the prerogatives of this house and the democratic scrutiny of the whole process
we have to fight for an ambitious multiannual framework but we cannot do it effectively while simultaneously thinking about new budgets or new institutions
we have to make it very clear to the member states who will come to the negotiating table to say no that the treaty allows us to have the budget even if they block the decision
the debate begins only now and i believe that it would be irresponsible to move to a growing number of national corrections this will make the decision in @ november ] impossible
we are encouraged by the commitment shown by meps and by the fact that your analyses and recommendations coincide very closely with ours
the commission is committed to delivering proposals in the remaining areas by @ summer ]
of course some shortcomings have emerged
finally this review will reinforce supervision and enforcement across financial markets with a key role foreseen for the new ` european securities and markets authority ]
@ two thousand and eleven ] we count on the support of the ` european parliament ] in moving swiftly to adopt the necessary reforms in order to ensure they are applied as soon as possible thereafter
another important area touched upon also in dr } swinburne ] 's report is to improve the functioning and regulation of commodity derivative markets in line with ` g twenty ] principles
technological progress and rapid developments in financial markets have also ensured that regulatory devices which were state of the art some @ years ago ] are clearly outdated today
this should take proper account of the nature of the business with a view to ensuring a level playing field between actors and proper protection for investors as well as against disruptive market practices
we intend to be ambitious and comprehensive in tackling all challenges
many pieces have already been put in place not least the launch of a new % eu ] supervisory authority as of @ next month ]
like the commission the ` committee on economic and monetary affairs ] is reticent to go beyond mandating the approved publication arrangements but if a market solution is not found then legislation should be supported
allowing regulators full access to business models should ensure that they can continue as a venue for the discretionary crossing of client orders without allowing them to expand to proportions that will affect price discovery or to provide a cover for market abuse
fundamentally we must ensure the integrity of our financial markets
there has been agreement that practices like flash orders spoofing and pinging are unfair or even abusive
they are there to provide a market place for investors to channel capital to businesses and corporates who act in our real economy this fundamental function of the markets must be kept centre stage in all of our minds as we go through the legislative process of & mifid ii ]
investors in the % us ] cannot understand how we in the % eu ] operate without such a tool
the possibility currently to arbitrage across % eu ] member states to find the best interpretation of the same rule should no longer be a possibility
yet this solution ensures that proportionality can be maintained in allowing for significant differentiation within the categories for regulated markets mtfs sis bcns and derivative platforms
mr president i have difficulty explaining to those uninitiated in financial jargon precisely what my report on dark pools refers to
i believe that the commission in their consultation document may have gone a step further in widening its definition of organised trading facilities to include all venues that bring together buyers and sellers
the report more broadly is an assessment of the implementation of the & markets in the financial instruments directive ] of @ two thousand and seven ] with respect to equities and seeks to address structural issues currently apparent in the equities markets
given the timing of this own initiative report and its culmination in a plenary vote @ this week ] i also believe that the ` european parliament ] has added significantly to the commission 's recently released consultation on the & mifid ii ] review which takes into account many of the issues raised in deliberations in the committee
despite this being a highly technical report i am encouraged by the high level of debate that has occurred in the committee i am glad that the hard work of my colleagues has managed to establish a broad base of support across political groups turning ! one hundred and ninety four ] amendments into ! twenty six ] compromises which most groups were able to sign up to
the report formally refers to the trading of financial instruments including dark pools which are financial transactions and shares conducted without pre trade transparency otherwise referred to as non displayed trades
this means a significant loophole may be closed
the new level of scrutiny being suggested for operators of dark pools should be welcomed by investors as while they currently provide protection from the wider market they at least have the potential for abuse
there has been general industry acceptance particularly among investor groups of its necessity but for the @ three years ] since mifid implementation the market participants have failed to come together to provide a ) european ] consolidated tape
during the compilation of this report and its amendment it was clear that the biggest deficit in & mifid ] implementation has been the lack of a market version of a ) european ] consolidated tape
they are not there for intermediaries or the interlopers to interact with one another
in the absence of clear data it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions on their role positive or negative and so before we propose legislative actions we need to make sure that we have data so that we do not impose legislation that may be detrimental to the effective functioning of ) european ] markets
however the committee found it much harder to come to agreement on the role of certain market participants in particular the benefits or not of high frequency trading strategies
the micro structural issues currently affecting the equity markets have been a topic of heated debate in committee
as well as this in terms of & mifid ] waivers the ` european parliament ] and the commission agree that these need to be redefined and their implementation needs to be standardised across the % eu ]
i also think it is in the interest of the internal market and we need the internal market to remove obstacles and have a single rule book throughout the % european union ]
i think we can be really proud of ourselves but of course everything hinges on the application and the enforcement
i too believe that the regulation and the directive do not constitute an obstacle they actually remove obstacles
i suppose there is not anybody in this room who does not have an [ ipad ]
something that we have been discussing a lot lately and we will discuss it later @ today ] is fighting terrorism and sharing information
it will create the trust that agencies need to share information
this regulation is without doubt a comprehensive change to many issues surrounding the processing of data and the implementation of the regulation is key what businesses do not want is heavy handed regulation and what consumers do not want are complicated rules that give no greater clarity on what their rights are
my group and i have at times had serious reservations about the content of these proposals and the direction negotiations took on certain issues but i hope that now we are at the end a pragmatic and workable solution has been put in place
these issues were key for my political group and my hope is that the new rules will increase consumer trust and create a level playing field legally across the % eu ] where businesses know exactly what they can and cannot do which in turn will attract future investment in the digital single market from outside the % eu ] and allow innovation and industry to flourish
both the & data protection regulation ] and the & law enforcement directive ] are about creating trust in our individual systems and therefore creating more trust for our % eu ] cross border cooperation
we thankfully ended up with a far more sensible and workable set of ideas related to consent fines notification periods scientific research direct marketing in legitimate interests and derogations for small and medium sized businesses
this data protection legislation will only last up to another @ twenty years ] like the last but if it is capable of establishing technology neutral and principles based rules it will be successful
however we currently operate under a legal regime that was created before ` twitter ] ` uber ] and ` amazon ] were twinkles in any billionaire 's eye
this directive is not about constraining law enforcement
the rules will improve cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime in * europe ]
criminal law enforcement authorities will no longer have to apply different sets of data protection laws according to the origin of the personal data saving time and money
businesses will equally benefit greatly from this reform
following publication member states will have @ two years ] to prepare for applying the general data protection regulation and to amend or repeal their national laws
it means that individuals will have more information on how their data is processed and this information will be available in a clear and understandable way
the directive also sets a standard that has to be met by any future datasharing instruments at % eu ] level
privacy friendly techniques such as pseudonymisation will be encouraged as will data protection by design
because the new rules become applicable in @ spring two thousand and eighteen ] this timeframe gives member states and companies enough time to adapt to the new rules but we need to ensure these @ two years ] are used in the best possible way to get ready
) dutch ] presidency and also the preceding % luxembourg ] presidency
you are about to adopt data protection laws that will allow us to take full advantage of the digital single market because this is a key basis for the creation of the digital single market
the right to erasure and to be forgotten will be clarified
the new regulation will remove the differences between the current national data protection laws
getting this balance right will be a key priority in the years to come and the police directive will be a strong framework for this work
we may need best practices or guidelines in specific sectors such as energy and health which make increasing use of personal data and need to develop privacyfriendly solutions
there will be a level playing field and noneu companies when offering services in the % eu ] will have to abide by the same rules as % eu ] companies
the regulation in fact replaces ! twenty eight ] national laws while the directive has to be transposed into national law
i would like also to thank my ` dg just ] colleagues and all those who have played a role in this monumental agreement and i would like to invite all members of this ` parliament ] to endorse it @ tomorrow ]
this right will be balanced with other rights such as the right to freedom of expression
this was also ! one ] of the conclusions of the extraordinary meeting of justice and home affairs ministers @ two days ] after the # brussels attacks ]
individuals will have the right to know when their data has been hacked
the new police directive will allow for smoother exchange of information between member states police and judicial authorities while ensuring a common and better standard of data protection
member states will need to share more information with each other and with % eu ] agencies like ` europol ] and ` eurojust ]
we will work in particular with data protection authorities to ensure a uniform application of the rules
an individual has the right under certain conditions to ask that search engines remove links leading to personal information about them
the reform will boost legal certainty for businesses with a single set of rules across * europe ]
on the contrary it means that we need to make sure that the relevant data is available for the relevant law enforcement officer and for the right purpose
the commission will work with them to ensure they are well prepared for their new tasks and we want to have an open dialogue with other stakeholders notably businesses to ensure they are aware of their obligations and also that any doubts about the application of the new rules are verified
the commission welcomes the final text that is before you
thanks to the ! one ] stop shop companies will only have to deal with ! one ] single supervisory authority
so the commission will work closely with member states to make sure that existing laws are adapted or repealed as necessary
companies and organisations must notify the national supervisory authority of serious data breaches as soon as possible so that users can take appropriate measures
let me now say a few words about the commission 's strategy for the next steps after @ this week ] 's historic adoption of the data protection reform
the commission wants to ensure a dialogue between the actors to make sure we are all ready for the big day in
it will also be easier for people to transfer their personal data between service providers
as the commission said @ last week ] in its communication on interoperability of information systems in the area of freedom security and justice we need to fill the gaps left by our current information systems but this does not mean mass gathering of data without purpose
member states will also have @ two years ] to transpose and implement the police directive
let me now take you through the various benefits of the new rules the regulation will reinforce the tools to allow people to regain control of their personal data
it is about ensuring the correct and lawful treatment of personal data in the law enforcement context which also includes the personal information of victims or witnesses of crime
that is good for citizens
a very good job was done
it is good for businesses
which will be applied equally in every member state
we will also be able to set a gold standard for the digital market of tomorrow when these standards will be essential for each and every new technology product and service
i am convinced that respect for data protection is not only a precondition for trust and innovation in a digitalised economy but it will be an important key for the success of our ) european ] economies in the future
@ two thousand and fifteen ] the agreement found in @ december ] under the % luxembourg ] presidency is an important signal as the finalisation of this file by the end of @ two thousand and fifteen ] was announced by the commission and ` parliament ] 's presidents as well as the heads of state in the ` european council ] several times
this compromise which we have found in an intense democratic debate in a legislative process @ throughout recent years ] is a huge step forward towards creating a single legal environment for the digital world of tomorrow and this is our chance as ) europeans ] to have a significant effect on it
stronger consumer transparency and choice is building new opportunities for trustful secure and consumer friendly products and services
everybody out there is waiting for us to formally finalise and present the long expected & eu data protection regulation ] and data controllers their consultants member state governments and data protection authorities are eager to do what from now on will be the most important thing to get this single data protection law of the % european union ] into practice as soon as possible
with new rights such as data portability and new principles like data protection by design we are further developing the protection of our privacy and self determination in times of big data and the internet of things
i want once again to thank the shadow rapporteurs the rapporteur for the police directive } marju lauristin ] and all the colleagues here in ` parliament ] in the commission and in the ` council ] as well as all the people involved in this democratic process for their hard work their honest and open engagement and contribution to this result
the newly built consistency mechanism in the future ` eu data protection board ] and a strong sanction regime will ensure that there will be equal opportunities effective rights and legal certainty for everyone on our market which as the biggest common market in the world nobody will be able to ignore
we ) europeans ] not only export a high protection of privacy and consumer rights online
it is the result of intense negotiations in both legislators bodies and in the course of a trilogue on the basis of our first reading in @ march two thousand and fourteen ] and a general approach in the ` council ] from @ june ]
at the same time we are for the ~ first ] time in ) european ] history regulating the application of a fundamental right for the whole ) european ] market by a directly applicable % eu ] regulation we are deepening and harmonising the existing rights and standards from the @ one thousand nine hundred and ninety five ] & directive on data protection ] and creating a single legal standard for the protection of personal data which is fit for the digitalised society of tomorrow
the directive is also very important as the first comprehensive instrument to regulate data protection for law enforcement
this time is crucial for some points
the use of big data is important for business but also for science and research and in the end for personalised products and services for us as users
this is a huge step forward
we are replacing ! twenty eight ] different legal frameworks on data protection with ! one ] single legal framework and building a gold standard for the protection of the fundamental right to data protection and privacy which we also want to defend globally in the global environment of the global market which we are creating
it is bringing a remarkable reduction of bureaucratic burden
but i think that we showed that the % european union ] can deliver on this substance that we can deliver in this democratic process with huge steps forward
@ today ] ` parliament ] lays the stepping stones towards a truly ) european ] digital market and @ today ] * europe ] shows that privacy and security go hand in hand
for companies to which we provide a market opener ! one ] law for ! one ] continent as an international gold standard
i thank rapporteur } philipp albrecht ] i thank rapporteur } marju lauristin ] and i thank all the colleagues in the ` european parliament ] because this is a historic day for * europe ] a day which shows that if we work together we can deal deliver results for citizens
so thank you from all my heart to all those who have helped make this possible @ today ]
madam president in @ two thousand and twelve ] as the then commissioner for justice i presented the legal text to protect the privacy of citizens and to facilitate data exchange for police work @ four years later ] after difficult negotiations with member states and after a fierce lobbying campaign we have an almost unanimous agreement
and for security forces which get more efficient access to data in order to fight crime and terrorism
whose personal data will be better protected
! one ] point i can mention is that the commission will produce a citizen 's guide to make sure that individuals have easy to understand practical information on how to obtain redress in case of complaints
i would like to say that as we understand it the ) european ] data protection authorities i
so the commission will now examine the opinion in depth and address the working party 's recommendations in its final decision
now we are preparing the legislation which will balance this properly for everybody in * europe ]
so we are now in a very sensitive period when we must be especially careful about the protection of privacy and private data
identifying the balance and the right of access to data on the part of law enforcement authorities
we will have to review all our adequacy decisions which relate to the transfer of ) european ] citizens data to ~ third ] countries this is the hot topic of @ today ] which some of you mentioned as well and i would like to use this opportunity to inform you about the position of the commission on
here i come to what you mentioned in relation to the rest of the world
madam president thank you very much
data protection is vital for many reasons
i used to be a member of this house and i recognise many of you as partners in crime
i am happy that the plenary vote will allow us to sign both the general data protection regulation and the directive on data protection in the field of criminal law enforcement
as you know the ` council ] very much welcomes the agreements that our ! two ] institutions reached @ last december ] on the & general data protection regulation ] and the directive on data protection in the field of criminal law enforcement
in the negotiations on the regulation and the directive ` parliament ] and ` council ] have consistently acknowledged that protection of personal data is a fundamental right
as a result we agreed to empower individuals with strong and enforceable data protection rights
this resulted in a general data protection regulation laying down harmonised rules for processing of personal data
these new rules will end the fragmentation stemming from differences in implementation of the current directive
the new legislative framework enhances legal certainty creates a level playing field for companies and reduces administrative burdens
furthermore the directive on data protection in the field of criminal law enforcement will ensure effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation
an important element is that it will cover both crossborder and domestic processing of personal data
the directive will facilitate the exchange of personal data between law enforcement authorities
at the same time it will guarantee a consistently high level of data protection
@ tomorrow ] 's vote will make the % eu ] 's data protection rules ready for the digital era
in an increasingly digitalised world almost all the personal details of people 's lives are held on a database somewhere and the protection of that information becomes increasingly important
the protection of that information throws up some obvious issues the security of the information held who has legitimate access to it and how to protect it from highly sophisticated criminals
these are not easy issues to resolve
we all live in democratic societies more or less anyway but the state has never had such a wealth of information potentially available to it and the possibility of potential misuse by it
we may feel safe now under our present governments but we do not know what the future will hold
imagine what } stalin ] } hitler ] and } mao tse tung ] could have done with the goldmine of information that exists now
as the % european union ] becomes more centralised and undemocratic we cannot know what the shape of its government will take in the future
therefore the protection of individual citizens most private information must remain the responsibility of democratic nation states answerable to their people
the right to the protection of personal data is enshrined in the & european convention of human rights ] and the & european charter of fundamental rights ] and they seek to protect the individual 's right to privacy for instance protecting private medical records and preventing insurance companies from potentially misusing personally and very deeply held private information
i am very confident that the ` european court ] will help us to have better legislation better applied legislation and that it stands together with the commission i would like to thank the commissioner and her teams for what she has done
this is one of the biggest pieces of legislation ` parliament ] has ever enacted and i think we should be thankful for something that ` parliament ] does very well and that is quietly and deliberately members of this house the rapporteurs } jan albrecht ] and } marju lauristin ] but let me just say it because i know all the work they put in all the shadows
but let me just say that this is what ` parliament ] does very well to enact a piece of legislation which yes as mr } voss ] said still has some problems on the research side on the issue of parental consent
we did not all agree with many of these very difficult issues but at the end of the day we have a directive and a regulation which is the only one of its kind in the world and i think for cross border legislation that is something of which we should be proud
it comes after @ four years ] of negotiation with the ` council ] and for that it is a major achievement
the regulation gives % eu ] citizens new positive rights including the ability to know when your data has been hacked the use of plain language in requests for personal data the appointment of data protection officers and the fines which really were needed because now people know that this is real legislation that will last and stand the test of time
this has meant that we have created a package which has been comprehensive
at the beginning of this process i think many felt that this could not happen yet it has happened and @ today ] we will vote the whole package instead of just one regulation
i think that is a great achievement for this ` parliament ]
i think it is one of which we should all be proud
madam president i am afraid i am not here to sing with the angels after so many years let 's be honest we did not achieve the aim
we wanted simple harmonised rules and legal certainty with the right balance between protecting individuals and the free flow of data
i am glad we have achieved ! one ] pillar integrity but in * europe ] we are not building common rules on exceptions
the result i am afraid is fragmentation legal uncertainty and complexity
we wanted to provide a legal playing field reducing red tape and boosting the single market
our hope was to pave the way for the digital single market by removing borders barriers and burdens but these rules are not future proof and could actually be a break to innovation
madam president the data protection framework that we are about to adopt is what it is but i think what is important is to stop looking at digital innovation as being in conflict with data protection
nobody will win from this conflict and there will only be losers
so people need to trust and in order to entrust their data they need to understand why their data is collected and for what reason it is used
this occurs all over the % eu ] and we must put a stop to it
i want to urge both the ` council ] and commission to look at the support systems for victims particularly the specific needs of trafficked children who have very different needs to those of trafficked adults
there are children in my own region who are trafficked but we find that even after registration with social services many trafficked children just disappear because they remain under the control of their traffickers they find it just too easy to re traffic these children
in the % uk ] @ last year ] alone ! three hundred and twenty five ] children were identified as being suspected victims of trafficking
one who is another 's property and a helpless victim of some dominating influence you might be forgiven for thinking this is a definition of human trafficking
trafficking of people be it women men or children is a criminal offence and on the increase in all member states
in the % uk ] we estimate approximately ! five ] ! zero ] victims of which ! three hundred and thirty ] are children
extreme poverty family breakdown and domestic violence contribute to some of the root causes of human trafficking
in fact it is a definition of slavery trafficking is today 's slavery
mechanisms for victim support need strengthening
it is worth waiting until this late hour to hear it because there are many people in this chamber @ today ] including the authors who understand the complexity of this brutal modern day phenomenon but also understand that the % eu ] is expected by its citizens to tackle this modern day scourge
mr } barrot ] talked about the need for new legislation we hope we will see the commission proposal very soon
> this morning ] at the hearing of commissioner designate mrs } malmstrm ] we also saw a positive response to our proposal for an % eu ] anti trafficking coordinator
if you start to put together the various pieces of this puzzle at least we are moving forward but the sheer scale of the problem described by } anna hedh ] means that we really have to turn words into action with trafficking being such a complex phenomenon touching on so many different areas such as forced labour organised crime sexual exploitation and child abuse our response must be multi pronged and holistic
mr } barrot ] listed many of the things that we would like to see as a reality and if they come together in a package across the % eu ] we will have a determined policy which % eu ] citizens will see as a plan of action at the moment % eu ] citizens understand the scourge of trafficking but they do not see the holistic approach and they do not understand what the % eu ] is doing as a whole
i am happy that commissioner designate } malmstrm ] underlined her commitment @ today ] to come forward with a new legislative proposal very soon and i am also happy to see the ) spanish ] presidency underlining not just the fight against trafficking but related issues such as violence against women
it is important that these all come together to show real determination and heart in this proposal
although the hour is late we now need the words to be turned into action and the authors have done a good job for us @ today ]
@ two thousand and thirteen ] it already has officers working within member states police forces and our ) german ] sirene officer is attached to the % uk ] 's ` serious organised crime agency ] and his } name is jan per ruehmann ]
it has executive powers and although % britain ] is not yet a member of the ` schengen group ] the % uk ] is expected to joint sirene in
i dislike the % european union ] and what i love most are the ancient liberties of my countrymen which i want to preserve
as you know the member states bear full responsibility for the system at their level and given that % finland ] did not volunteer for an earlier testing campaign the national issues there were revealed only in the last round of tests which were mandatory for all member states
the commission is further ready to provide any possible support needed to overcome all the remaining challenges
the objective of bringing the system into operation as soon as possible remains therefore an imperative which must not be compromised
it increases the functionality capacity and performance of the system and it also improves governance and accountability through greater safeguards on data protection so i believe that once the system is in place and operational we will all benefit from the high quality of reliable services and the new information which
experience shows that this is only possible through overall constructive cooperation and solidarity promoted by all the stakeholders
without access to sis ii the % uk ] would not have access to alerts issued by other member states in order for example to locate and apprehend criminals who escape into the % uk ] from ! one ] of the other * schengen ] countries
what a mistake that would be
the % uk ] has been preparing for @ a number of years ] to connect to sis ii it is responsible for ! eighteen ] of the total charge to the % eu ] budget as well as the domestic costs
i would like to thank the rapporteur mr } coelho ] not only for all his work on & schengen ] on this particular dossier but also for his flexibility when the ` council ] proposed having a separate legal instrument to ensure the participation of the % uk ] and % ireland ] in the policing aspects of the & sis ]
it would have been great had this measure been ready before the # london olympics ] as there was some concern that the fact of the % uk ] not yet being hooked up would make it difficult to identify criminals or terrorists
i look forward to the % uk ] finally taking part in the schengen information system
also we need to explain to our citizens the double standards that ) romanians ] and ) bulgarians ] will face when they approach the * schengen ] border controls
it is to the advantage of all our citizens in the % eu ] and that includes citizens of the % united kingdom ]
i do not support as the coalition government does and particularly the ) conservative ] party opt outs from ` jha ] including potential opt outs from & schengen ] it will be hugely disadvantageous to the citizens of the % united kingdom ] and not in our national interest
while this particular company may not survive this particular hack and this situation the technology that they make is part of a wider industry and it continues and the market remains largely unregulated
i would like to know whether the commission can guarantee that member state authorities are implementing international obligations and doing so using the same yardstick
we need % eu ] rules to know the impact such % eu ] made systems have here at home and in the rest of the world and to prevent exports to human rights violators
has ` hacking team ] violated % eu ] sanctions against % russia ] and % sudan ] by selling systems that can be used to violate the human rights of journalists political opponents and human rights activists as the hacked and leaked documents suggest
the commission followed up quickly to implement this international agreement and adopted a commission delegated regulation in @ october two thousand and fourteen ] ensuring that the export of those technologies is controlled
it is indeed a key concern that the export of cyber surveillance technologies could be misused for supporting oppressive regimes or the violation of human rights
these are wide ranging categories of goods software and technologies normally used for civilian purposes but which may have military applications or may contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as nuclear materials electronics or navigation systems
however the commission monitors and supports the consistent implementation of the controls by member state authorities to that effect it set up in @ september two thousand and fourteen ] a surveillance technology expert group with member state experts which has been meeting on a regular basis
this communication identified options for an ambitious modernisation of the system
the commission is now conducting a public consultation and will finalise the impact assessment on those review options with a view to presenting as appropriate proposals to upgrade the % eu ] legal framework in early
in addition to that immediate reaction the commission recognised in @ two thousand and fourteen ] in its communication on the export control policy review that although the % eu ] export control system is robust and effective it cannot remain static and must be upgraded in order to face new challenges associated with new
it should be noted in this respect that controls on intrusion software became effective in the % eu ] only on @ one january ]
@ two thousand and fifteen ] the commission has taken note of concerns regarding possible unintended effects of controls on security testing tools which could possibly hinder research and has initiated dialogue with member states industry and ngos to further assess the need to adjust
since its establishment
technologies of concern
this includes options to address human security issues as the ones we are discussing here @ today ]
mr president when documented reports first emerged @ four years ago ] that companies based in the % eu ] had been involved in the supply of cyber surveillance technologies which may have been misused in connection with violations of human rights the commission immediately took action
~ firstly ] in @ late two thousand and eleven ] and @ early two thousand and twelve ] respectively the % eu ] arms embargoes on % iran ] and % syria ] were both updated to include prohibitions on the export of interception technologies for internet and telephone communications
! seventeen ] yet even in the % uk ] we seem to consider these people to be our friends
they show a failure by the ) italian ] government to hold firm on banning the export of this dangerous technology and a failure of common sense decency and basic morality in those who failed to consider the impact of their actions
mr president allow me to reiterate the commission 's determination to take on the challenges posed by the export of dual use cyber surveillance technologies we have acted resolutely over @ the last few years ] and have taken unprecedented action to prevent exports that might be misused in violation of human rights
it offers assistance so that elections can be organised in accordance with ` sadc ] principles and guidelines governing democratic elections
we want to clearly express that we are tough on the regime but we try to assist the people with the disbursement of approximately ! three hundred and sixty five million ] since the establishment of the global political agreement in @ two thousand and nine ] we are as i said the largest donor
the % eu ] will act and proceed in close coordination with all % eu ] member states
on @ eleven march ] together with ! twenty one ] embassies and representations the % eu ] issued a statement to express its concerns over the increase in what appears to be politically motivated intimidation and violence
we are calling on ) european ] governments and the % eu ] to intensify their engagement to use all their political influence in * southern africa ] to help bring about rapid change for the better in % zimbabwe ] and pave the way for properly monitored elections to be held in an atmosphere free from intimidation
it has called for an end to that violence and for all elements of the global political agreement to be implemented
maybe just maybe there is at last some movement in the right direction
~ firstly ] that as long as } robert mugabe ] remained in power protected by a small self serving element in ` zanu pf ] and the security forces pillaging the nation 's wealth for their own enrichment there was little prospect of real change
the ` mdc ] is supposed to be in a power sharing coalition but in @ the past few days ] ) mdc ] ministers and mps as well as human rights activists have been beaten up and arrested
i suppose } mugabe ] is increasingly nervous on ! two ] counts
and just @ a week ago ] on @ thirty one march ] the ` southern african development community ] which includes % south africa ] and all % zimbabwe ] 's neighbours at last voiced its grave concern at the resurgence of violence in % zimbabwe ]
you know when } mugabe ] is worried he starts to panic his police and militia start attacking anyone they see as opponents
~ secondly ] that it was up to the people of % zimbabwe ] with the support of their ) african ] neighbours and here i name % south africa ] in particular of course to bring about the necessary change
it has appointed a team to work out a road map to peaceful free and fair elections in % zimbabwe ] and @ today ] that team is in % harare ]
until there is evidence of real change the restrictive measures specifically targeting } mugabe ] and his close allies must remain in place
the chairman of the ` kimberley process ] mr } mathieu yamba ] from the % democratic republic of the congo ] has decided unilaterally and without consultation to allow the marketing of diamonds from % zimbabwe ] 's $ marange mine ]
! hundreds ] of people were dispossessed of their homes and there are reliable reports of his security forces torturing raping and even killing local residents the sale of diamonds from the $ marange mine ] will help } mugabe ] to further consolidate his tyrannical hold on % zimbabwe ] and indeed enrich his ) zanu pf ] thugs
i therefore urge the % european union ] as a party to the ` kimberley process ] to raise this scandal at the highest level and insist on the restoration of consensus based decision making in the ` kimberley process ]
more generally i have long been calling for a similar system a certification to cover other natural resources extracted in * africa ] in order to prevent brutal governments or guerrilla groups from selling minerals to fund arms purchases
the swift and timely adoption of the package could prove that the community method is the right approach to use in going forward
i am also in agreement with many of the honourable members that after the hard work of negotiations we have to get the deal done
in addition this package could demonstrate how ) european ] institutions can cooperate in a responsible efficient and constructive manner in such an important field
certainly i agree completely with what we are doing and i also would love to see us adopting automatic binding sanctions and also the reverse qualified majority voting system
that would ensure that we would stay out of crisis in the future
prevention is better than cure and this is all about prevention
mr president although the % united kingdom ] is not a member of the * euro zone ] and i hope it never will be we have a vested interest in its success
i wish the * euro zone ] well and i regret that i am unable to support the proposals on economic governance we are debating > tonight ]
the proposals before us grant the commission sweeping new powers
had these powers been limited to * euro zone ] countries alone i would not have objected but instead we see the commission and many members in this ` parliament ] including ms } wortmann kool ] for whom i have the utmost respect using the crisis in the * euro zone ] as an excuse to extend the power of the % eu ] into the economic governance of the % united kingdom ] and other countries who do not use the euro
balanced and healthy public finances are a necessary condition for sustainable growth and improving employment which is the goal of the current legislative package that is why it deserves your support as many of you have underlined it is an essential building block
that is also why we need a genuinely and effectively functioning mechanism to identify and correct macroeconomic imbalances in order to prevent the kind of crises we have seen for instance in * ireland ] or the credit boom we have seen in % spain ]
therefore your vote @ tomorrow ] will be a great opportunity to achieve a historic milestone of complementing the monetary union finally with a true and genuinely functioning economic union which we definitely need and thus enabling the % european union ] to come out of the current serious crisis with lessons
on the political tack human rights remain at the top of our agenda with % nigeria ] including in our regular ministerial dialogues
and for the rule of law and human rights
the root causes of violence and radicalisation will continue to be addressed through the european development fund
we continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of the schoolgirls and for those responsible to be brought to justice
the % eu ] is also present in % nigeria ] with humanitarian assistance under ` echo ] providing ( eur five million ] to the north eastern states particularly in response to the on going food and nutrition crisis
the new fund will focus its activities in particular in the north of the country supporting the health and energy sectors
the % eu ] listed ` boko haram ] as a terrorist organisation @ last month ] @ one day ] after their designation by the ` un ] demonstrating the % eu ] 's firm and determined condemnation of the group 's unacceptable criminal activities which touch upon both ) christians ] and ) muslims ]
madam president honourable members we remain concerned about the situation in % nigeria ] where a series of violent attacks continue to terrorise the population the high representative } cathy ashton ] has strongly condemned the indiscriminate killing of ! hundreds ] of civilians and the abduction of more than ! two hundred ] schoolgirls in % borno ] state
our thoughts are also with the families of the girls who are desperate to see their children return home safely
possible human rights abuses perpetrated by the ) nigeria ] military have to be investigated and those responsible brought to justice the % eu ] stands with the people and government of % nigeria ] in the fight against terrorism and violence
i agree with } jean lambert ] we need to work together
@ yesterday ] i met ` unicef ] which reminded us that @ later this year ] we will mark @ twenty five years ] since the signing of the & un convention on the rights of the child ]
but in the long term we need to do more
the international community is now looking at what should replace the mdgs and it is clear that safe schools need to be part of what we are talking about
in the mdgs we pledged that every child should receive an education but as @ two thousand and fifteen ] approaches there are ! thousands ] of schools closed in % nigeria ] because of terrorist attacks
madam president it is almost @ one hundred days ] since these girls disappeared and i think we should pledge @ today ] that we will keep on campaigning until the girls are released and not let this issue go off the headlines
people who want change in % nigeria ] people who want action against ` boko haram ] who want accountability from their government and the conviction of those responsible for atrocities
obviously we express our sympathy for the friends and the families not only of the girls from % chibok ] but of all of those of different faiths who have been abducted injured and murdered over the years by the growing violence of ` boko haram ] and the often violent state pursuit which has all too often substituted indiscriminate force for targeted action
a major complaint of civil society has been about the apparent absence of the government response
i am glad to take part in this debate @ today ] and to see a focus on those persons who suffer persecution because of their faith
belatedly it has brought international focus on the situation in northern % nigeria ] where ! thousands ] of ) christians ] and those of faith have been slaughtered by ` boko haram ]
in the last legislature along with my colleague mr } belder ] i hosted ) christians ] from northern % nigeria ] in the ` parliament ]
when they left he asked his wife to go to the other ) christian ] men in the village to get help to take him to hospital
these are the stories of ! thousands ] across northern % nigeria ] men women families targeted because of their faith
let this ` parliament ] have the courage to call it as it really is the persecution of those of faith
the final wording would then be calls on the countries in the # six party talks ] to continue working together to ensure that the talks on ending the % dprk ] nuclear programme are resumed
mr president there seems to be broad agreement between the groups on ! two ] oral amendments to this report
the ~ second ] one is on rephrasing and streamlining paragraph ! nineteen ] on the accountability of human rights defenders
i hope these can be adopted
one is to combine paragraphs ! six ] and ! twenty two ] to bring the trade related positions to the same paragraph
we are also actively engaging with a broad range of stakeholders including sub national local governance judiciary authorities civil society and progressive business associations
this initiative will address human rights environmental duty of care and due diligence across sectors
tackling deforestation in the * amazon ] is essential not only to fight global biodiversity loss and climate change but also to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication
free trade agreements with countries in the region are another way to engage and promote cooperation on international commitments on climate and the environment in particular in the context of their trade and sustainable development chapters
the global framework should include specific targets for halting the loss of primary forests and for preserving ecosystems health in line with the proposals in the % eu ] biodiversity strategy
the commission supports the implementation of the & ilo convention one hundred and sixty nine on the indigenous and tribal people ] as well as the implementation of the un voluntary guidelines on governance of tenure of land and forests
i look forward to working closely with you on this important issue
we are determined to take a leading role internationally and to use diplomacy trade policy and development cooperation tools
with regard to % eu ] policies the commission is working on a series of actions to fight deforestation as a part of the follow up to our communication on stepping up % eu ] action to protect and restore the world 's forests adopted in @ july ]
it also goes hand in hand with improving the livelihoods of local populations and respecting the rights of indigenous people
the challenges that affect the * amazon basin ] are complex multi faceted and require close regional cooperation among the countries that share it
therefore these issues are systematically raised within our established mechanisms for political dialogue and cooperation
territories of indigenous people and local communities in the * amazon ] overlap to a very large degree with the world 's best preserved biodiversity and ecosystems
the % eu ] is determined to work in partnership with and support efforts by partner countries in the * amazon ] to tackle deforestation
it is also essential for the indigenous people that call it home and depend on it for their livelihoods and their traditional culture
the environmental dimension of these challenges is closely interconnected with fundamental socio economic factors as well as issues such as widespread poverty corruption human rights abuses stability and security
human rights including those of indigenous people and local communities in the * amazon ] as well as environmental protection are at the core of the values underpinning the % eu ] relations with ~ third ] countries including the countries of the * amazon ] basin
we will continue to support action against deforestation and forest degradation as a part of the implementation of the & paris agreement ] including through continued commitment to raise the ambition of forest competence of nationally determined contributions and continued support to the international initiative on reducing emissions for deforestation and forest degradation
protecting biodiversity and fighting deforestation requires protected areas and good governance
@ two thousand and nineteen ] as part of the follow up to @ last year ] 's communication the commission will present in @ two thousand and twenty one ] a legislative proposal and other measures to avoid or minimise the placing of products associated with deforestation on the % eu ] market and to promote forest friendly imports and value chains
the % eu ] is addressing the root causes of deforestation through our significant development assistance to forests land use sustainable livelihoods and indigenous people in the * amazon basin ] with a total of ongoing projects amounting to ( eur one hundred and sixty six million ]
at the global level the % eu ] will push for an ambitious @ post two thousand and twenty ] global biodiversity framework to ensure that by @ two thousand and fifty ] all of the world 's ecosystems including forests are restored resilient and adequately protected
this integrated sustainable development approach is at the centre of our development cooperation policy
finally our human rights instruments have been mobilised on rights of indigenous people and of environmental defenders unfortunately too often at stake in the * amazon ] region
other action taken by the commission includes the creation of a multi stakeholder platform on deforestation which will meet for the ~ first ] time in @ october ] and of an % eu ] observatory that will use the earth observation and trade data to facilitate information on global deforestation
the indigenous people and local communities have therefore to be part of the solution
to tackle the issue of deforestation we also need to engage more with the private sector especially with the % eu ] to get stronger commitments from their side on sustainable sourcing
despite being told by the commission that the deal will encourage % brazil ] and the * mercosur bloc ] to meet climate obligations we remain sceptical
ratification of the % eu ] ` mercosur ] trade deal is still on the agenda
we are part of the problem
my last remark is as follows i hope that the eu farm to fork strategy the biodiversity strategy and more importantly the review of % eu ] trade policy just launched will look closely at the complexity of our supply chains and the absolute contradiction between our agriculture environment trade and climate policy
yet we have restricted the ability of our own grain growers to supply the market because of the rules we have imposed but have no control over what comes into * europe ]
and that 's why we 're back here @ today ] talking about landgrabbing and deforestation
we 're very alarmed about the continued loss of forests in the * amazon ] to commercial agriculture logging and mining
madam president and thank you commissioner for your commitment to the future but of course we have had this debate here in the chamber before
and i think we need to get into our heads the scale of this
@ last summer ] we all watched as the * amazon ] burned and despite our lofty words and our concerns nothing has changed
you 're talking about an area of over < sixty million hectares ]
we are alarmed at the proposed law to legalise landgrabbing by the ) brazilian ] government which would further incentivise taking of public lands into private ownership and the destruction of more forest area
our own meat production demands protein for animal feed and it comes from % brazil ] and other places
but people in glass houses should not throw too many stones
we continue to be concerned about the opening up of ) european ] markets to more beef and soya and its consequences for deforestation
yet in % brazil ] we will see them rise by ! ten ] because and mainly due to deforestation
the ` mercosur ] deal will lead to more deforestation of the * amazon ]
small farmers in % ireland ] are not just worried about their livelihoods they are also sick of the hypocrisy of the % eu ] calling out for member states to reduce agri emissions while preparing to import more contaminated environmentally destructive food and feed from * south america ]
it says there will be an assessment which is political speak for doing nothing despite the fact that ` fianna fil ] and the ` greens ] opposed it before now
climate change mitigation is not a threat to farmers
it will be bad for small farmers in % ireland ] and all across * europe ]
now we have the ` mercosur ] deal which looks like the ` european commission ] working in the interests of big business helping them to find the cheapest raw materials with zero regard for the environment climate system breakdown or indigenous people
we also know that the } bolsonaro ] administration has fired most of the directors of the ` environmental institute ] controlling illegal logging
so this ` parliament ] needs to ask for real safeguards on the preservation of the * amazon ] and that will be key in the discussion on the free trade agreement
and @ today ] using the covid crisis to recognise land grabbing is simply unacceptable
but if we want to achieve our goals and we know what our goals are then the * amazon ] is key in that fight
exactly @ one year ago ] the ` european commission ] signed an agreement with the ` mercosur ] countries on free trade with the inclusion of a socalled binding sustainable chapter
that @ a year ] after the signing off the situation is getting worse and worse
we know that they fired the head of % brazil ] 's space agency which collects data on forests
he encourages the human rights violations against the indigenous population
so how can we actually explain that we use the money here to tackle climate change but we encourage the disaster abroad
we are responsible for < thousands of hectares ] square kilometres of deforestation by importation of beef and soya
the % uk ] alone is responsible for eating up around ! five hundred ] football fields of beef produced in clear cut rain forests every single year
we 're investing ( billions of euros ] every single year to tackle climate change and we invest ( billions of euros ] to support our ) european ] farmers especially the beef farmers against this unfair competition on the international markets
let me reassure you that the commission is not only providing significant technical and financial assistance to countries in the region to tackle these challenges and that we talk to and listen carefully to the indigenous people who are directly impacted and at risk as you
we are also working on domestic policies to reduce the % eu ] 's own footprint on forests abroad in addition in close cooperation with the ` european external action service ] and the diplomatic services of % eu ] member states
the commission is already taking action to support efforts across the globe to tackle the root causes of deforestation and to protect the rights of indigenous people and local communities which are threatened by land grabbing and deforestation
in reply to many of you who mentioned the government in % brazil ] we call on national authorities including ) brazilian ] authorities to take decisive action to address deforestation and to cooperate regionally and internationally to this end
honourable members to conclude yes there is still a lot of work to do and we will continue our work on the legislative proposal that we will present @ next year ] and i look forward to working closely with you on this important issue
it is a way of having dialogue and working with % brazil ] and the other partners in the region to push and encourage each other to live up to the commitments we have made together in the & paris agreement ] and to work together on the environmental issues
since many of you have mentioned free trade agreements let me recall that all our modern free trade agreements contain ambitious even if imperfect provisions to promote trade and sustainable development
i can only say to you that i am following closely developments in * europe ] and i am determined to take strong action also at home
in this respect i look forward to the outcome of your future deliberations on the legislative initiative report by ms } burkhardt ] on the legal framework to halt and reverse eudriven global deforestation after @ years ] of damages that cannot be repaired
the fact that we conclude negotiations for an association agreement with the ` mercosur ] countries does not mean that we agree with all the policies of those governments in all areas clearly not
we stand ready to provide technical assistance in order to ensure that deforestation decreases rapidly substantially and permanently should there be a clear willingness for cooperation on this issue
we need to scale up efforts towards preserving critical ecosystems such as forests not only as a solution to climate change and biodiversity challenge but also achieve sustainability and resilience
we are using all available diplomatic channels to engage on this important topic
it has also shown a clear understanding that the multifaceted challenges that affect the * amazon basin ] its immense natural resources and its populations need to be tackled in a holistic manner and in the context of sustainable development objective working in partnership with the countries in the region
this is very true and challenging but i can reassure you that this is exactly what we are doing i work very closely with all my colleagues concerned to bring together environmental agricultural trade health and climate aspects of deforestation
in this situation what can be more shocking than hearing a minister calling to get rid of environmental protection while people are distracted by # covid ]
resistance was big before but now in this line that leads ) brazilian ] environmental policy i don 't see any chance for that deal
control agencies dismantled penalty payments for illegal logging stopped and if this were not enough the } bolsonaro ] administration is supporting a law which would legalise land grabbing in the * amazon ]
so thank you again for this continuous pressure which helped us a lot in the tough negotiations
the directive updates the definitions of criminal offences affecting the % union ] 's financial interests
without your tireless efforts and your continuous support in moving this initiative forward we would not be here @ today ]
this will make it an efficient tool to protect the financial interests of the % eu ] and i invite more member states to join
the & antifraud directive ] is a decisive step forward and in combination with the ` european public prosecutor 's office ] we are entering a new era the & anti fraud directive ] will essentially frame the activities of the ` european public prosecutor 's office ] it
yes to achieve the consensus on how we are going to fight against fraud against the % union ] 's financial interests by means of criminal law this is a historical moment i am happy to be here at this historical moment in spite of the late hour
it also introduces common rules as regards sanctions and statute of limitations linked to these offences
i am confident that the & eppo regulation ] can be adopted as soon as possible with a strong backing from ` parliament ] i am happy that ! twenty ] member states have already notified their participation in the ` eppo ]
will provide the material scope for the investigations and prosecutions of criminal offences falling within its competence and will ensure that the ` eppo ] can rely on harmonised definitions of these offences across the member states
the work has just started
maybe it is only natural that we are here in > the middle of the night ] in the $ parliament building ] speaking about this extremely important affair in the true spirit of prolongation because after all it was the ` council ] that prolonged this process for quite a while
having common rules designed to protect the financial interests of the % union ] is not only necessary but it also makes the recovery of misused funds significantly easier and more efficient
even more the directive is an important step for the effective functioning of the future ` european public prosecutor 's office ] which will soon be established through enhanced cooperation
but i am glad that for the most important issues our hard working rapporteurs were able to include review clauses in the final text
achieving concrete measures for the protection of the % eu ] 's financial interests is the key to ensuring the most reliable and efficient use of ) european ] taxpayers money
so once again my sincere compliments to the rapporteurs on their excellent work
however let us not forget that tax is a member state issue
she confirmed @ last month ] before all these allegations that it was firmly on her agenda within the framework of % eu ] competition law
they cannot be avoided
global country by country reporting by companies of their sales and profit is long overdue
they need to know that whatever the commission concludes is the result of an independent thorough and public proper inquiry
although as there has been some confusion today on whether there will actually now be an investigation a reassurance from the commission is necessary that this is going to be the case the ecr group has long argued for further action at national eu and global level to tackle tax evasion tax fraud and indeed aggressive tax avoidance
as a quasi judicial investigation i believe we should await its outcome before rushing to judgments or holding a witch hunt
tax competition is of utmost importance in the % eu ] and it encourages us to remain competitive globally
i am proud to say that it was my prime minister during the % uks ] presidency of the ` g eight ] @ last year ] who led these discussions on reporting and tax transparency and it will be discussed again in % brisbane ] @ next week ]
the solution lies in proper enforcement of existing national and % eu ] systems and through greater transparency and greater international cooperation in tax matters through the ` g eight ] and ` g twenty ] level
if commissioner } vestagers ] investigation raises questions that need to be answered then they must be answered here in this chamber
she is leading the commission investigation into tax schemes in % luxembourg ] the % netherlands ] % ireland ] and several other % eu ] countries
people are frankly not willing to accept companies that go out of their way to avoid paying what they legitimately owe
we should base our actions and debates not on leaks and not on part of the picture but on a full independent assessment by our own competition authority that reveals all the facts
mr president @ todays ] discussion has been precipitated by # luxleaks ] and the allegations in the press @ last week ]
the ` ecr ] calls on commissioner } vestager ] to deliver her investigation as quickly as is feasible but also asks for reassurance @ today ] on the independence the scope and the procedure for keeping this ` parliament ] informed
for the % eu ] to play a role does not require more % eu ] legislation or centralisation of powers nor does it need tax harmonisation
although it is a global problem the % eu ] can play a meaningful role in this field at commissioner } vestagers ] hearing i specifically asked her what she was going to do to close the double irish tax loophole as it may constitute state aid
clearly this investigation needs to have the trust of the public
the definition of hypocrisy in the is the practice of claiming to have higher standards or more noble beliefs than is the case and i do not think anyone in this chamber could disagree with me today when i say that this perfectly sums up the position of the president of the ` european commission ] here today
when mr } juncker ] was campaigning for the post he stood on a platform of stamping out aggressive tax avoidance by multinational corporations across the % european union ] yet it is now clear from recent revelations that he had not practised what he was preaching
i would like to finish by asking this ` chamber ] why the people of * europe ] are increasingly sceptical about the % european union ]
allow me to tell you with ! one ] simple sentence it is because it is always a case of do as i say and not as i do and therefore i believe mr } juncker ] you have ! two ] options
let us have this investigation but my request is for an investigation before the @ end of the year ]
it has to be a serious investigation and not just about ! three ] special cases in ! three ] countries
let us be honest about it
that is my point to you mr } juncker ] you have spoken about ! two ] decisions taken by the college > this morning ] and i am in favour of that exchange of information
if there is ! one ] topic now where we need more * europe ] we have it here on the table and it is a clear indication that what you are saying does not make any sense
we have a specialist there
he was a specialist in offshore tax schemes in the % isle of man ] he is a specialist and he is not here @ today ]
i have received many letters and emails of concern from parents major health and consumer organisations midwives nurses and doctors organisations as well as ` unicef ] and the ` who ]
until there is real consensus in the scientific community about the validity of this claim we must not allow it
the evidence we currently have is not conclusive and no evidence exists to support the use of such a claim on follow on formulas
if in the future synthesised dha is proven to be truly beneficial to babies we should make it an essential ingredient in all formulas and not allow it to be used as a marketing ploy by a specific brand
i would urge you to support this resolution
because it was not binding enough
we have still not created a system that is capable of transferring the money from the banks to the real economy that is the problem
because i think we lack ! two ] elements
we have a directive on the deposit guarantee schemes
why the difference
we have a regulation on credit rating agencies and ! one ] on capital requirements so a lot has been done on financial regulation
that was not always the case in the past
we need a new economic strategy
because ~ first ] of all they have solved their banking problem and we are still in the middle of a banking crisis
we have a directive on market abuse
since we are going to discuss this issue later > this morning ] i will now concentrate on the other main elements on the agenda of the ` council ]
actions regarding the issue of unemployment
only @ two weeks ago ] we had a debate in this plenary which led to the adoption of a resolution of this ` parliament ] on where it sees the priorities in the ) european ] semester
rising energy prices for companies and consumers are a real cause for concern
the need to generate jobs especially in order to fight youth unemployment remains ! one ] of our main priorities
we have however proposed not to set ! twenty eight ] individual national targets any more but rather to rely on a bottom up approach leaving more flexibility to the member
that is why we are urging governments to put in place youth guarantee schemes
base progress on improving the business climate remains uneven
effort we also need to have the major economies
and finally in the light of the crisis in % ukraine ] no one will need to be reminded of the costs and dangers of * europe ] 's continuing energy dependence
corner waiting is not an
weak competitiveness is still a crucial concern in a number of countries so implementation of our @ two thousand and twenty ] strategy and the country specific recommendations remains as necessary as ever to improve their growth prospects
the commission is committed to doing its share of the work for example making our own rulebook more business friendly completing the integration of networks
level some countries should do more to ensure that government services and regulations support industry 's
growth is returning in * europe ] and this is also true for the most vulnerable member states
tape negotiating trade agreements and supporting economic diplomacy and the internationalisation of
this is good news for public budgets because debt levels are still too high in several member states
actors it is also feasible
the & single supervisory mechanism ] is on track to begin its work @ later this year ]
budget this is possible to do through a reinforced governance
this i am sure this is also going to be discussed and i hope that a clear signal is given in the ` european council ]
smes supporting the development of
now there is an urgent need to deliver the final element the & single resolution mechanism ]
companies need a clear long term regulatory perspective to base their investments on and stay competitive
since we started work on our banking union in @ two thousand and twelve ] we have seen the positive impact in terms of helping restore confidence and stability in * europe ] 's markets
the same is true for climate action policy in relation to energy
years assuring better access to finance in particular for
smes and that innovation projects and investment levels are cranked up because only technological progress can guarantee competitiveness in the long
this is again a slight improvement
@ yesterday ] in ` ecofin ] no progress was made as regards the respective roles of the ` council ] and the commission and the commission remains deeply concerned as to the compliance of the ` council ] 's approach with the case law of the court let me be clear the commission has been working and continues to work constructively with you for an outcome that is as close as possible to our original draft which is fully compatible with and upholds the primacy of % european union ] law i also expect the ` european council ] to endorse the approach of the commission 's communication on a ) european ] industrial renaissance
skills cutting red
domestic consumption and investments are set to expand further thus reducing * europe ] 's dependency on the recovery of the external sector
supporting investment in new technologies through horizon
needs that labour markets are effective and conducive to job creation by companies
the problems are clear some of our industries have lost competitiveness investment in research and innovation remains too low holding back the modernisation of our industrial
firms this is part of what we are
) european ] firms face higher energy prices than most of their leading competitors and have difficulties acquiring qualified labour and capital in affordable conditions
many of the issues in fact have to be dealt with at member state
we cannot be alone in the world in this
at the same time green technologies are critical for growth and jobs provided that we create the right environment for them to prosper sustainably
it is also why we are organising a follow up conference in % brussels ] at the @ beginning of next month ] in order to keep up the momentum on what i think is the most important social challenge in * europe ] today unemployment and specifically youth unemployment
the commission has already presented its assessment of the economic context and the state of play of macroeconomic reforms in countries under additional scrutiny
i was glad to note that there was a large degree of convergence on the priorities
i expect the ` european council ] to take stock of the progress that has been achieved so far in the response to the economic crisis and focus on the policy decisions needed to consolidate the recovery we need to keep up the pace of structural reform and reinforce our specific
we have to listen to the science and the evidence
this is not just an environmental argument but an economic one
we need sustainable employment in the energy sector i know from my own constituency in % wales ] that they look to the % eu ] for leadership
we need binding targets for energy efficiency as well as for increasing renewable energy
we need to keep our promises to the people that we will work effectively to combat climate change
the commission 's own research shows that higher targets result in reduced dependence on energy imports and in savings on health spending
creating jobs is essential particularly for young people
this also applies to the areas of climate and energy policies the single market and the new industrial policy
the recovery is leaning more on domestic demand and has become more broad based across the member states including most of the vulnerable member states
we expect to see a strong response from the member states and we stand ready to support them in a constructive partnership for reforms to strengthen the recovery and boost job creation
especially domestic investment public and private in % germany ]
it means that a relatively high wage economy or group of economies embracing the ideology of globalism and the process of globalisation must drive down wages to compete with the emergent economies
if we refer back to a meeting of ` ecofin ] held on @ sixteen february two thousand and twelve ] about the european semester of @ that year ] we find that reforms need to focus on labour markets in particular wage setting mechanisms to ensure efficient adjustment of labour costs
the agenda of the forthcoming meeting refers to the european semester which among other things includes inspection by the commission of reform programmes including reforms of the labour market
mr president to find out what a meeting is about it is sometimes necessary to put together different sources as though they were pieces in an intricate jigsaw
the agenda also mentions industrial competitiveness and the importance of a strong and competitive industrial base as a driver for economic growth and jobs
listen to the economics mr } barroso ] you talked today about the possibility of an industrial renaissance in * europe ] which sounded good
and then you say but we must pursue our climate change carbon targets
the ~ second ] mistake was to allow the free movement of people to southern and to * eastern europe ]
i suspect the next ` european parliament ] will be very much more exciting than this one has been > this morning ]
this policy of economic unilateralism on climate change is what is destroying jobs in * europe ] and the electors are going to have a chance in @ seventy two days ] time to give their verdict
the ) european ] dream is crumbling absolutely crumbling
and most of the meps here yes they want a job yes they want to be re elected but the enthusiasm for this project is dying
we in the % united kingdom ] who have been the most open country with regard to immigration of any ) european ] country through a history that has lasted @ hundreds of years ] now have ! four thousand ] migrants @ a week ] who come to % britain ] from the % european union ] and stay for @ a year or more ] these are the ! two ] realities that have hit home to people the % eu ] does not work economically and open door migration is fundamentally changing societies in ways that people do not want
lighter touch regulation all very encouraging
if there appears to be an imbalance between market and social elements then that is mainly because social policy still lies largely in the hands of the member states
as was mentioned by many members of this ` parliament ] progress has been achieved in the area of economic governance important financial regulations have been mentioned such as the & growth and stability pact ] and the very important measures taken by the ` european central bank ]
banking union is of course of vital importance
we must ensure the integration of ) european ] companies into global value chains as well as enhance our competitiveness through an ambitious trade and investment agenda
@ two thousand and thirty ] this of course is an area which will need to be developed further in the near future
stimulating investment in innovation and new technologies is also a priority
leaders will therefore be looking to support mainstreaming of competitiveness across all policy areas and to conduct systematic competitiveness proofing to make sure that we deliver on implementation
this is not a random set of issues
i do not need to highlight the importance of this issue in the light of recent events in % ukraine ]
we are approaching the end of an economic cycle
it will look at how to strengthen the regulatory framework and the internal market
the consequences of the crisis are still being felt
i would like to take this opportunity to thank this ` parliament ] for the significant work which you have undertaken on various aspects of the semester
competitiveness is also vital when we look at our industry from the perspective of the international markets
the ` european council ] will identify areas where further work is needed to reach these objectives
a strong and competitive ) european ] industry must be seen alongside a coherent climate and energy policy
incomes this is what we are fighting for and it should be the task of the commission and the ` council ] to
happening of course a fairer distribution of income would also give more money to those who would spend it and create new jobs especially
still there is a ) neo liberal ] cloud which is preventing the ` council ] from seeing the reality for example the enormous social problems we have in * europe ] we are one the richest continents or the richest continent but the income and wealth distribution are growing more and more unequal
you spoke about the skilled labour which is needed
but what is the ` council ] doing against the brain drain
interesting i am not a fan of the intergovernmental method but he is proposing something which is highly intergovernmental so that is
@ two thousand and thirteen ] where is the big improvement many people speak about
euroscepticism is growing right across the % european union ]
mr president how can there be any credible and efficient commercial policy industrial policy or competition policy if the ` council ] and the commission continue to overlook the race to the bottom in terms of taxation amongst member states if they continue to overlook the scandal of tax evasion
the same is happening to ) european ] taxpayers while at the same time as they are demanding terrible taxes from the middle classes and the poor in countries like mine % portugal ] the rich and the super rich are taking advantage of this system
i am sure the house will join me in congratulating } joseph daul ] on his re election as president of the ` european people 's party ] ` ppe ]
mr } daul ] at your congress you discussed how the situation in % ukraine ] highlights our dangerous dependence on ) russian ] oil and gas
my question is why do you not send } angela merkel ] to % moscow ] to talk to them about the crisis in the * crimea ] and about energy policy rather than leaving it to } john kerry ]
~ secondly ] if we speed up the switch from fossil fuels to clean energy we not only regain our independence from % russia ] we also meet our commitments to fight climate change
so why does the ` ppe ] continue to oppose the binding national targets that we need for the green energy switch of which mr } barroso ] spoke
mr president i think it is important that we reflect on the fact that while we look inwards at the problems in the % european union ] the president of the ` council ] has rightly alluded to the situation in % ukraine ] which should make us look outwards as well
for example in % ireland ] we know that many people have not seen the improvements in their family situations that we would like them to see but we have got to admit that stability has been restored and that growth is there
it is far too modest and we need to stimulate it
i would support mr } van nistelrooij ] 's comments that we need to bring manufacturing into the % european union ] so that we can create sustainable jobs
lastly what we had in % ireland ] in the # celtic tiger ] era was unsustainable
you talk about excitement in politics and a leaden debate but with the greatest of respect i do not want excitement in politics
will you please commit to staying in this chamber and listening with respect to the responses of those who will be here
your practice in the past has been to walk out
and could i add that you say that the enthusiasm for the % eu ] is dimming
~ secondly ] facilitating exchange in the services sector
this would mean saying a clear no to all forms of protectionism while aiming for trade that is both fair and responsible
the % eu ] does not show itself to be very serious about this when we see negotiations taking @ more than twelve or fifteen years ]
personally i see ! three ] key areas for our future trade policy
they should consist of ~ first ] promoting a digital dimension of international trade
we need to have clear priorities and deliver
well ~ first ] of all it must not be business as usual
i am convinced that a proper implementation of the strategy should start with an inventory of all current trade negotiations for this to occur you would need to reallocate sufficient human resources within the commission services
however on the other hand there are increasing numbers of those concerned and fearful of the potential impact of the trade issues we have to be able to come up with new ways to communicate these issues more effectively and to address citizens concerns
and lastly providing our companies especially smes with real new business opportunities
in the future ! ninety ] of global growth in the world will take place outside the % eu ] this is why if we want to support jobs in the % union ] and also defend our position as the main promoters of universal values through trade in the world we have no time to lose
as you know the commission is currently conducting an in depth impact assessment analysing the various options with regard to the treatment of % china ] in anti dumping investigations and we will hold further political discussions on this in @ the coming weeks ]
the report on a new forward looking and innovative future strategy for trade and investment underlines the importance of pushing both jobs and growth as well as the value agenda that focused on human rights good governance and sustainable development
they contain some very valuable comments
the % eu ] has been a frontrunner over @ recent years ] in pursuing the integration of sustainable development into its policy and this engagement has also been recognised by many international organisations and our trading partners
~ second ] the strengthening of the human rights dimension including gender in our sustainable impact assessment
furthermore we are supporting responsible business practices including enhanced transparency for large companies on non financial information as well as the uptake in implementation of internationally recognised guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility
but being a frontrunner is of course not enough
this strategy builds upon progress already achieved since the adoption by the ` european parliament ] in @ two thousand and ten ] of the ! three ] resolutions in this area first the introduction of binding and comprehensive trade and sustainable development chapters in all our free trade agreements
in this regard we have set some priorities notably the effective implementation of trade and sustainable development chapters better linking trade policy instruments to development cooperation including with a view to supporting the @ two thousand and thirty ] agenda and the promotion of responsible supply chains and of private sector engagement to integrate sustainable development objectives as part of core business strategies
so i want to thank you very much for these reports
it is a central pillar of our market access strategy in trade agreements and trade defence
we agree that the multilateral route for trade liberalisation is of course the most efficient and the most equitable when it is possible
we have taken very careful note of the request for our future trade policy to have a stronger focus not only on these issues but also on manufacturing priorities and services
we will continue in this context to balance the needs of manufacturing services and agricultural producers in setting our priorities for negotiation
and in this respect we reiterate in the report that the trade and sustainable development chapters in our ftas should be enforceable in order to make sure our trading partners effectively implement those rules
mr president the ` sd group ] welcomed the commission 's communication trade for all and in particular its shift towards a value based trade but frankly words on paper are easy and now we need to see the commission deliver on its promises and we are not convinced that the current trade negotiations are truly reflecting these new values
for us the ` wto ] is still the priority as it guarantees the poorest countries can take full advantage of trade liberalisation and make full use of its participation in international trade by consistent trade rules across the global community
this is why open trade has to be accompanied by adequate flanking policies including access to a reformed globalisation adjustment fund the losers from trade liberalisation cannot and should not be left alone
this is a significant achievement and our companies and workers have benefited from that
my group has always pushed for ftas to be used as levers to promote % eu ] values and as such we welcome the reference to sustainable development human rights fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption and tax evasion
however as a previous speaker has just said we cannot ignore that trade does not benefit all it is therefore essential we make sure the benefits of trade reach the widest range of people
and we agree with the commissioner that the proliferation of ftas should not lead to the death of the multilateral trading system
we agree that under certain conditions trade can bring sustainable growth and jobs for instance we have just had the ~ fifth ] anniversary of the & eu korea free trade agreement ] where % eu ] exports to % korea ] have increased by ! fifty five ] helping to turn a trade deficit into a trade surplus
we can draw conclusions in our trade agreements on how to fight against corruption how to make governments more accountable and how to help the freedom of civil society
or the like ~ secondly ] i believe that the % eu ] has a big role in creating the enabling the environment for sustainable development in our trading partner countries
it was put together through consultation with more than ! fifty ] civil society organisations including trade unions and i believe you need to return to that document many of us endorsed it during our election campaigns and many more have come to
it is a ! twenty ] page document called the alternative trade mandate and it says trade should be about exchange with ecologically and culturally distinct regions equitably sharing their product skills and creativity
we ) greens ] think that trade can be an important instrument to help development cooperation to promote human rights and for better environmental protection
but i say can because i think that there is a potential but this potential is far from being fulfilled
quite the opposite actually because trade currently and at the moment often increases inequality and leads to poverty and that urgently needs to change
i think actually your trade strategy commissioner is a step in the right direction
but now we need to move onwards from the nice words about human rights and values towards the implementation and that needs to include also binding rules
but instead what we see the commission doing is proposing trade sanctions against partner countries that are not readmitting migrants
so instead of having trade sanctions on human rights violations we are actually sanctioning countries who are not closing their border enough and i really hope that colleagues will join me in saying that this is just outright wrong
also it is absolutely urgent to readjust our trade policy so that it contributes to social justice and equality and security in * europe ]
mr president i would like to thank the rapporteur as well for her support for this trade strategy and the free trade agreements that it champions within this trade report represents a strong mandate for opening up and developing global trading relations
it provides a solid steer for pursuing trade that delivers for consumers across * europe ]
while i would have hoped for a more positive tone with fewer reservations and red lines laid down on the whole it is a step in the right direction and i am pleased to see a recognition of the role that competition plays in benefiting consumers the importance of chasing offensive interests such as public procurement access and investment and importantly a greater appreciation of the region of * latin america ] and helping our smes reap the benefits of this region
areas of concern still remain within this trade strategy protectionist measures in the form of a retaliatory public procurement instrument and continual insistence on gi protection for non agricultural products
this will be to the detriment of opening up new markets and our % eu ] offensive interests in negotiations
the % eu ] needs a positive ambitious and liberal trade agenda to ensure that trade deals are not only continually opened and negotiated but are also delivered and ratified
only in this way can the % eu ] show that it is serious about jobs and growth
our report sets out tools to ensure that we can trade more fairly reducing human and environmental exploitation here and abroad creating virtuous trade relations progress at home and enabling our trading partners to reach equal or better levels of human development as ours
this report offers concrete proposals to make sustainable development operational and i will highlight just ! five ] of them
the ~ first ] is making trade union and civil society engagement more formal giving greater responsibility to non state actors such as the ability to lodge labour rights complaints directly with the commission
the ~ second ] shifting from voluntary corporate social responsibility to effective and enforceable supply chain due diligence requirements allowing us to build on the recent political agreement on % eu ] legislation on conflict minerals
the ~ third ] properly recognising independent expertise by taking impact assessments seriously and undertaking them in a timely manner able to influence negotiations
~ fourth ] using incentives but equally having adequate deterrents notably through clear criteria to grant and withdraw & gsp ] privileges which requires in our view a new delegated act specifically on this point
and ~ fifthly ] involving fully the ` ilo ] in all trade talks and negotiations as we did with some success in the aftermath of the terrible # rana plaza ] disaster in % bangladesh ]
sustainable development must be enforceable
it must be visible and it cannot just be aspirational
when the commission presented its trade for all strategy it had ! three ] main objectives
we need to make sure that consumers really get the benefits of our trade agreements and that we reach out in a better way to smes
a ~ second ] goal was to emphasise the values of the % european union ]
we cannot solve all the human rights problems on earth through trade agreements we have to be realistic but we can contribute and we can do more by being more comprehensive by using our various policies on trade development foreign policy investment etcetera in a clever way
we can do more and we can enforce those values
we have a dedicated dispute settlement mechanism
and we want to go one step further
the ~ third ] goal was increased transparency
citizens want to be engaged they want to be included they want to know what trade is about
trade is as i said debated and this is good
outside of % brussels ] people and companies find out about our trade policy initiatives too late to be able to influence the outcome
we must find a way to inform them of our trade initiatives in time so they can fully participate and shape these policies
we have to be certain that these associations really represent the interests of our domestic industries
it is a way to leverage the single market on the global stage to strengthen the rules based and values based system and to make sure that trade rules help stronger standards considering people and planners
in a world which is rapidly changing with the economic rise of countries like % china ] or the * gulf ] states that do not share our standards and levels of openness this is not a luxury but a necessity
i am glad to see that the commission has ensured values are at the heart of the % eu ] 's trade strategy
the interest in and the debate about trade have increased significantly over @ the past years ]
it is not without reason that member state governments as well as parliamentarians decided to leverage the weight of our entire ) european ] economy on the global stage to have the best negotiating position
i certainly hope that these governments as well as national parliaments will continue to play an active role because it is too easy to pretend it is % brussels ] dreaming up trade policy or % brussels ] not publishing documents while we constantly have to push for member states to make mandate texts available for example
in addition there is a huge demand by people to have their voices heard
it is key that the capacity to engage people actively is created
we must do what we can but trade ministers at the national level as well as parliaments are perhaps the best positioned to address sector specific and regional elements of trade
if there are negative impacts to be mitigated policies must be made nationally
i believe that only when we play each of our roles and when we work together do we ensure transparency and engagement with a clear view of what is at stake not only in the % eu ] but globally
trade and foreign investments are indeed important tools in achieving economic growth sustainable development and protection of human rights which we expect from the commission and the ` council ] with regard to the implementation of the new trade strategy
mr president with all due respect to our colleagues in the different political groups and with different opinions i cannot give the green light to the attitude which i feel is contrary to our % eu ] trade strategies by politicising the trade agenda too much i believe that human rights and trade are not contradictory but complementary i believe that trade is a key development instrument that brings growth and wealth and therefore in the long term contributes to the development of human labour and social rights
i believe that we should treat our counterparts as trading partners on an equal footing and that this kind of treatment will bring a solid basis for ongoing dialogue and cooperation
i think that developing countries need social labour and environmental standards that correspond in the ~ first ] place with their level of economic and social development and any effort to bring binding requirements to impose binding requirements which unfortunately is an attitude becoming more and more popular in this chamber
however a note of caution the idea that member states should no longer have to cofinance projects with any of their own money seems a high risk policy
while it is all very well to say that some of the new member states are poorer than the old and so need special help the colossal amount of debt in the % uk ] and the very low gdp per capita in my region of % wales ] which was recently compared unhelpfully to the economic performance of % rwanda ] hopefully mean it will not be forgotten
removing a member state 's vested interest in ensuring its own money is well spent should not be an invitation to their misuse
mr chairman fundamentally this report seems to have some very good objectives helping the member states of the % eu ] who have been hard hit by the economic and financial crisis via ) european ] funding
we need to ensure that relaxing the cofinance criteria does not reduce accountability
reducing the project thresholds and simplifying the process will all help as well as the pre financing of agreed projects to jump start economies quickly
the & paris agreement ] is a major achievement of the international community
we have to take these grievances seriously
we condemn the illegal annexation of the ) crimean ] peninsula by % russia ] and we reaffirm our policy of its non recognition as well as that of sanctions against those involved
monetary and structural to strengthen the recovery and foster inclusiveness and also to better share the benefits of growth and globalisation
my ~ third ] point is on migration
the summit will address a number of issues relating to our neighbourhood
progress on ratification has been extraordinary making it possible for the agreement to enter into force @ less than a year ] after the # cop twenty one ] in % paris ]
naturally we tend to focus on our crisis in our part of the world but managing migration is not a ) european ] phenomenon nor solely a ) european ] responsibility
all parties in particular % syria ] and its supporters must allow humanitarian access to all people in need and all parties must ensure full compliance with the ceasefire
@ two thousand and eighteen ] we ask all ` g seven ] members to engage equally in the consultation phase as well as in the negotiating phase @ next year ]
indeed as recalled by the # european council of ten march ] the % eu ] remains strongly committed to a robust trade policy and an open and rules based multilateral trading system with a central role for the ` wto ]
the # g seven ] is a privileged forum to forge partnerships and launch collective initiatives for an equitable and fair sharing of responsibility
on a more positive note one can mention % iran ]
the % eu ] and its members are playing their full part in implementing the & paris agreement ] both through the development of our domestic policies and in keeping to our commitment to global solidarity
on climate change the global community needs to act urgently and move forward with the implementation of the & paris agreement ]
we are also committed to taking an active part in the follow up to the # un summit on addressing large movements of refugees and migration ] held in @ september last year ]
continued and full implementation of this plan of action is essential to build confidence that % iran ] 's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful in nature
against this background i believe that the ` g seven ] should in particular confirm its determination to work together through strong multilateral institutions confirm the agreement to use all policy tools fiscal
i would like to thank you for the opportunity to intervene on the subject of the preparation of the # g seven summit ] which will take place in % italy ] @ next week ] the ` g seven ] leaders as well as presidents } tusk ] and } juncker ] who will represent the % european union ] will be faced with difficult discussions
! seven ] i believe that the mission of ) european ] leaders is clear
the international political environment is currently particularly charged and the truth is that global cooperation can no longer be taken for granted
i refer in particular to the political transition in the % united states ] which seems to present us with challenges even with respect to basic policy principles which were until recently well rooted in the g
on various topics of global importance
the aim is to secure the ` g seven ] 's commitment to keep the global economy open and keep multicultural multilateral cooperation on track it is also crucial to give a clear signal that securing balanced and inclusive growth
even if the global economy is showing positive momentum political uncertainty surrounding the outlook is still very high
the % european union ] is committed to ambitious global action against climate change and we insist on maintaining global ownership of the & paris agreement ]
this is also something for the ` g seven ] to consider
the % eu ] intends to play a prominent role in the process leading to the establishment of the ` un ] & global compact on migration ] and refugees in
as for the situation in % ukraine ] the % eu ] continues to stand united in the conviction that the conflict can only be solved by diplomatic means
the ` council ] is aware that climate will be ! one ] of the most challenging issues at the # g seven ] table particularly in view of the positions expressed by the new ) us ] administration
the % eu ] will also continue to engage actively with international trade partners advancing on all ongoing negotiations for ambitious and balanced free trade agreements
the areas on which we can work together with ` g seven ] partners include assistance to mostaffected countries of transit resettlement efforts the exchange of best practices on return and readmission as well as increased cooperation on the fight against smuggling and trafficking
we support the joint comprehensive plan of action on the % iran ] nuclear issues which is an important contribution to the international non proliferation regime
but allow me to expand on a selection of issues of particular relevance to us
dealing with the migration crisis has been at the core of the political debate in the % european union ] including here in the ` european parliament ]
on % syria ] we should stress that no effort can be spared to bring the ) syrian ] conflict to an end
it is proving and it needs to prove that the transition to climate resilience and low emissions economies is irreversible
as you know in this house there are strong concerns over the negative effects of trade economic integration and technological change
it is a global responsibility requiring collective solutions that are in full respect of our obligations under international law
in % libya ] it is urgent to advance on the part of inclusive political dialogue and national reconciliation in the framework of the ) libyan ] political agreement
however the solution is certainly not to close our economies
instead we need to improve the daily lives of citizens by ensuring that the benefits of globalisation are more widely shared
it is necessary to ensure full respect for international law and especially the legal obligation to respect % ukraine ] 's sovereignty territorial integrity and independence
in the relationship between the % european union ] % european union ] big countries % japan ] % canada ] and the % united states ]
next time it could be a banking system a wider healthcare malfunctioning or something else
it is time to make cybersecurity a priority for all because a weak link in ! one ] country is a threat to everyone
that shows how crucial this # g seven ] will be on what is going to happen with the implementation of the & paris agreement ]
so we cannot give in in any way to what the ) americans ] are asking we cannot slow down
but this will also set the agenda for the # g twenty ] @ later on in the year ]
in @ two thousand and nine ] back then it was a g it was the first time when the global players were setting the agenda for the < two c ] target which ended up in the & copenhagen agreement ] then in @ two thousand and fifteen ] the phase out of fossil fuels was adopted by the ` g seven ] that was setting the agenda for the & paris agreement ] @ later on in the year ]
what the ` g seven ] is going to say will either make sure that & paris ] will be implemented as agreed or it will put the wind in the sails of conservative countries like % saudi arabia ] and % russia ] so the conclusion of the question is very simple and i would like to have an answer on that
we know that the % united states ] is trying to push back and trying to get the significance of fossil fuels back on the agenda whereas we all know that & paris ] requires a phase out of fossil fuels
but i think that as a businessman he is person who is subject to change and i think the # g seven ] is a great opportunity to convince him that what he has said in the past is not actually true
following on from what my friend mr } eickhout ] said i think climate change is going to be a hugely important issue here at the # g seven summit ] and especially the role of the largerthanlife character president } donald trump ] the & paris agreement ] is a global agreement and if the % united states ]
the upcoming # g seven summit ] will be a prime opportunity to put words into practice to show ) european ] leadership and to stand firm on our values and principles insisting that a rulebased international order remains one of the key priorities for us
i believe that the % eu ] should use the # g seven summit ] to recommit to the biggest economies on the plan to achieving the sustainable development goals all of them comprehensively
indeed the very reason why this is a g ! seven ] and not a g ! eight ] summit is that ! one ] key nation continues to disregard international rules and agreements with the central theme of the ` g seven ] summit being how to rebuild trust
they worry about high levels of inequality job losses and factory closures
this free trade agreement would send a powerful signal to the rest of the world that ! two ] of the largest economies are resisting protectionism and that openness to trade and investment remains ! one ] of the best tools to harness and shape globalisation and create more economic growth and jobs
that is the message the % european union ] must bring to % taormina ] and to our partners from across the world
when others step back from free trade the % european union ] must step forward partners such as % japan ] % mexico ] ` mercosur ] and % india ] are willing to do likewise
the wider need to work together on issues which affect the whole world has become more acute even since the ` g seven ] last met in % japan ] in @ two thousand and sixteen ] whether it be fighting climate change tax evasion or international terrorism whether it be promoting trade links
for us working together with our biggest partners around the world in a rules based system is a necessity
sustainable development or global economic growth the questions of @ today ] are global in their very nature
that was the thinking behind the ideas presented in our reflection paper on harnessing globalisation
these are compelling reasons why we aim to reach an agreement as soon as possible and in any case before @ the end of the year ] together we must make sure that the rules of the game best serve and protect our citizens and our societies
they see identities traditions and ways of living changing in front of their eyes
we need to preserve the spirit of cooperation in the ` g seven ] and also to continue to provide multilateral answers to the challenges we face
this also means maintaining and building on the achievements of the past and not giving in to protectionism and isolation
it is the way to harness and shape globalisation
mentioned that implementation of & cop twenty one ] should be ! one ] of the priorities and we fully agree
without rules based trade we cannot include important values like environmental or social values in trade
in that context the commitment to a ( eur one hundred and twenty billion ] investment package additional resources for the ` european investment bank ] and agreement on project bonds are most welcome as is the language and the emphasis on growth and public investment
certainly the need to increase progress on combating poverty within the % european union ] is an extremely important issue
we look forward to rapid progress on that including the question of minimum income so that people can live in dignity
i think that all of us in this house must be very concerned about the persecution and indeed some would say the genocide of ) christians ] throughout the * middle east ]
indeed i have been pleased to actually meet and talk with some of those ) christians ] and hear their stories of persecution of death and destruction and i think it is incumbent upon this house and these institutions to make sure that these terrible atrocities are raised on a continuous basis and that we deal with them in our discussions with these countries
we have only to look at the sights in % syria ] in % iraq ] and see the devastation of ) christian ] communities
and development assistance political dialogue and in specific support to freedom of religion or belief to everyone everywhere
mr president this has been a very useful exchange and i would like to thank all the honourable members who took part in this debate for their interventions
i visited % wittenberg ] the place of the # reformation ] in % germany ] and it was a delight to see the memorials there to } martin luther ] and @ five hundred years ] of the # reformation ] which has done so much to transform our society and which did so much to transform % germany ]
all persons should be able to practise their religion and worship freely individually or in community with others and to live free from fear
the millennial diversity of many societies is put at risk by the rise of the sectarian hatred no continent has been spared from this kind of violence from * south asia ] to * sub saharan africa ]
) christians ] are discriminated against harassed and persecuted in large parts of the * middle east ] and the number of ) christians ] is drastically decreasing
for this reason our approach has focused on security as well as on culture and education but also on diplomacy governance and national reconciliation
the european instrument for democracy and human rights now finances around ! forty ] projects related to freedom of religion and belief accounting for more than ( eur fifteen million ]
our work against violence on ) christians ] that may not be as evident but which is just as important
he has placed special emphasis on the implementation of the ` un ] & rabat plan of action ] that includes positive elements to address hate speech and to counter violence perpetrated in the name of religion
very often it is more about power than about religion itself
as we see in % syria ] and % iraq ] not only ) christians ] but also ) yazidis ] ) shia muslims ] and other religious communities are suffering from discrimination harassment and persecution therefore a long term strategic approach to protect ) christian ] and other religious groups
mr } jn fige ] the special envoy for the promotion of the freedom of religion or belief outside the % eu ] has also worked on the implementation of the % eu ] guidelines on freedom of religion and belief particularly on his visits to % iraq ] the % united arab emirates ] % jordan ] and % sudan ]
a peaceful and diverse future for % syria ] also depends on their education
such violence may be committed by state or non state actors for a number of different reasons
~ seventh ] education is the best tool for building open societies and for avoiding radicalisation
the ` council ] 's ` working party on human rights ] created a taskforce on freedom of religion
a number of concrete initiatives on diversity and tolerance have grown out of this network
think of the ) syrian ] children who can only remember a country at
~ third ] the ` eeas ] also actively encourages cooperation among member states on this issue
war it is essential to teach them about their country 's incredible diversity and about @ centuries ] of peaceful coexistence
must focus on addressing those ideologies and changing those state structures that encourage discrimination and violence
@ next year ] we will devote ! eight ] of the % eu ] 's humanitarian budget to education in emergencies in the % syria ] crisis the % eu ] 's contribution to education is over ( eur one billion ] through the various financing instruments we have put in place since the beginning of the conflict let me conclude on another part of
ideology is certainly one of them but it is not the only one in many cases the persecution of ) christians ] and other minorities has political ethnic or economic reasons
in this day and age education in emergencies and protracted crises has become particularly urgent
it belongs to those lands and this is something we cannot possibly forget if the * middle east ] loses its incredible diversity it would also lose its vitality and its greatest richness at the same time persecution rarely targets just ! one ] minority
in many parts of the world a sustainable future for ) christians ] and other religious groups depends on the work we are doing today for peace for national reconciliation for inclusive institutions % syria ] again is the clearest
~ fourth ] during @ this year ] the % eu ] 's special representative for human rights } stavros lambrinidis ] continued being actively engaged on freedom of religion and belief
this is something we need to keep in mind if we want to make a real difference to the life of ) christian ] minorities around the world
at home diversity respect and inclusiveness are not abstract concepts to ! millions ] of people they can make the difference between persecution and security between fear and freedom between life and
it works on informal information exchanges on events and situations on the ground and in preparation of % eu ] resolutions at the ` united nations ]
we always react with public statements or private demarches to condemn violence against ) christians ] let me also focus on other actions we have taken in defence of persons belonging to minorities
~ first ] since the adoption of the % eu ] guidelines on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief in @ two thousand and thirteen ] their implementation has remained a key priority for % eu ] action
this ` parliament ] has often focused on the persecution of ) christian ] minorities in the * middle east ] and rightly so
this applies to people of all faiths or none including to ) christians ]
but whilst ) christians ] are being burned across the world the world 's atheistic elites wring their hands and turn away
every year since @ two thousand and five ] ! ninety ] ! zero ] ) christians ] have been eliminated from this planet
if the elites do not do anything to protect our ) christian ] communities then it is time for ) christians ] themselves to rise up come together once more and fight the ) islamic ] terrorists who are trying to destroy them
the names of their attackers are well known ` al qaeda ] ` isis ] the ` muslim brotherhood ]
how often do we take these liberties for granted
and national governments must renew their commitment to these basic liberties in their dealings and discussions with countries across the world
through their sacrifice we like past generations enjoy the benefits of a fair and democratic way of life
we have a responsibility to provide a beacon of hope to those who continue to suffer daily to support those whose sacrifice has not yet been translated into freedom for themselves and their families
mr president @ yesterday ] in the % united kingdom ] communities and families paused to remember those across the nation who had laid down their lives in defence of freedom
we are afforded fundamental freedoms of thought belief opinion and expression and without restriction or recrimination we are able to attend a religious place of worship
over ! two hundred and fifteen million ] ) christians ] are persecuted globally i think the person we should give great support to in his work is } jn fige ] the % eu ] special envoy for the promotion of freedom of religion and belief
frankly when i talk to people about this they don 't believe it
mr president this is a very important debate and colleagues have outlined the extent of the persecution of ) christians ] in the world
i think that there is a lack of awareness generally about how widespread this problem is and how serious it is
he does incredible work and he is tireless in pursuit of this ideal where we all have freedom of religion and belief and i believe he needs more support both within the commission and indeed from this house because if we don 't tackle this type of abuse and persecution and if we allow it to increase as is happening then i 'm really concerned about the future for christianity and for people of all faiths
mr president throughout the % uk ] and in many other countries throughout the west many ) christians ] have been denied the right to wear a simple expression of their faith such as a crucifix in public life the right to hold and express faith is a fundamental human right which must be protected and defended equally
the % uk ] was founded on a ) judaeo christian ] culture and whilst we respect and appreciate the contribution of all this must be respected
but the trials and tribulations of ) christians ] in many countries throughout * the west ] pale in comparison to what many must face on a daily basis throughout other parts of the world
the persecution of ) christians ] ) shia ] and other religions and ethnic minorities during the rise of the ` islamic state ] was well publicised
as the terror of ` islamic state ] rule is rolled back we must ensure that the seeds of future conflict and societal discontent are averted and reprisal attacks are not carried out
this may not be an easy task but the cycle of shifting persecution as power changes hands must be broken
as these countries are rebuilt the place of ) christians ] and their rights must be protected
the recent political instability caused by the sudden resignation of } hariri ] as prime minister of % lebanon ] is a sharp warning that the # shia sunni war ] propagated by % saudi arabia ] and % iran ] could be spreading into the country and we must ensure that minorities are not marginalised in any political fallout from the future developments in this country
) christianity ] is an ancient religion with firm roots in the * middle east ]
if the countries of the * middle east ] are ever to get past this cycle of religious persecution they must develop a more inclusive model of national identity that extends beyond religion and is fully inclusive and respectful of all minorities who deserve to practise their faith free from persecution and in many cases
and this ` house ] is passionate about those rights but when it comes to those who share the faith of our founding fathers many times we do not do too much and this is a sign we are abandoning ) christianity ] we turn a deaf ear and remain silent
we will not forsake our biblical roots and we remain committed to those who are suffering because of their faith in christ i implore you
of ) christians ] in % morocco ] would you say madam that he is a fine example to ) muslims ] throughout the world and that this is the sort of leadership that we should see in the ) muslim ] world protection of ) christians ] by ) muslims ]
of expression and the freedom to exercise political rights
we are conscious of these facts and we are closely following the political situation in % venezuela ]
the commission believes that the request for asylum made by } manuel rosales ] and its acceptance by the ) peruvian ] government is a bilateral case and that it is not for the commission to pronounce itself on the merits of this request
he was granted political asylum in % peru ] after being charged with corruption in % venezuela ]
! twenty three ] i wish to assure ` parliament ] that the commission will continue to follow developments in % venezuela ] closely
we hope that the democratic institutions of % venezuela ] will respect the rule of law and preserve democracy in the country whilst complying with the obligation arising from the international agreements signed and ratified by % venezuela ] including the & american convention on human rights ]
and specifically the provisions on political rights set out in article
the commission 's commitment to supporting and strengthening democracy and the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms will continue to be reflected in our cooperation policies and relations with % venezuela ]
we are aware that recently the judicial institutions have opened some judicial processes against opposition leaders in % venezuela ] we know that some sectors of ) venezuelan ] society have criticised the proliferation of measures which they consider adversely affect the right to freedom
the commission has taken note of the explanation provided by the president of } rosales ] party according to which he has gone into hiding for his own protection
i would like to underline the importance that the % european union ] attaches to freedom of expression and opinion a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law
as president of this ` parliament ] of ) british ] commissioners of all parties } roy jenkins ] } arthur cockfield ] } chris patton ] prime minister } ted heath ] and } winston churchill ] all true ) europeans ]
there are ) british tories ] ) socialists ] ) liberals ] we are ) europeans ]
i as a ) british conservative ] reserve the right to object that is my final word
we will stand with our partners and our allies and if my party leader seeks to rip up @ thirty years ] of work by ) british tory ] pro ) europeans ] he is wrong
i wish to thank all my fellow members of this house particularly our president } hans gert pttering ] with whom i had the honour of securing ) british conservative ] membership of the ` group of the european people 's party ] i wish to recall the service of lord plumb } henry plumb ]
the leader of my party mr } david cameron ] has made a serious mistake
you the public does not support
if you do succeed you will trap those southern countries inside an economic prison in which people 's suffering will be untold while the northern countries will find themselves paying forever a massive bill and interest rates that are far too high for their own economies
if you succeed then we should change the name get rid of % european union ] and call it the debt union
the model itself is failing and yet what you want is to double the size of the bail out fund
the public right across the % union ] no longer supports the currency and the battle for % spain ] has not even begun
you even want to increase the scope of the bail out fund so that along with the ` ecb ] you too can go on buying yet more of your own debt you are using the crisis as a massive power grab to take us towards fiscal union
as the last ` european council ] is already @ a month ] behind us let me remind you that i already give a full report each time to your ` conference of presidents ] on the results of the ` european council ] just > a few hours ] after every meeting
following our agreement in principle in our @ october ] meeting that such a treaty change is needed i had consulted the members of the ` european council ] about its possible wording and content
i know that you and your responsible committees have been following this matter closely not least during the work of the ` task force on economic governance ] which i chaired and which gave rise to meetings between myself and the ! seven ] chairs of the parliamentary committees most involved
! three ] points concern work to be done by the national governments first fiscal responsibility
on the ~ second ] day of our meeting we focused on our relations with strategic partners
this discussion confirmed the sense of determination and unity amongst the member states and the institutions
it is an essential piece in our efforts to make * europe ] more crisis proof
finally we agreed also on the position on % cte d 'ivoire ] in line with what the ministers of foreign affairs decided @ a few days previously ] sending a clear signal on the need to respect the results of democratic elections
with the benefit of your opinion the ` european council ] will be able to turn this draft decision into a full decision at its @ march ] meeting
finally the ` european council ] also had a very good and in depth exchange of views on recent economic developments and on how to deal with the challenges for all ) european ] economies short term and long term
~ firstly ] the ` european council ] asks the other institutions not least your ` parliament ] to make sure that the agreements reached in @ october ] on the basis of the task force which i chaired regarding the & stability pact ] and macro economic surveillance are in place by @ the summer ]
these meetings all showed that for our partners the % european union ] is not only an economic union and a trade bloc but also a geopolitical partner
this resulted in a statement by the eurogroup finance ministers on @ twenty eight november ] which was fully endorsed at the ` european council ] meeting
it must not be a bureaucratic process but a real occasion to have an in depth discussion on the state of play of our economy and the actions to be taken colleagues we know of course that we have to strengthen and deepen economic coordination and convergence inside the * eurozone ]
and ~ third ] the ! two ] countries with support programmes are forcefully implementing the necessary measures and we all welcome the efforts of those two governments of % greece ] and % ireland ] and their populations
as this amendment will not increase the competences of the % union ] all members of the ` european council ] agreed that it was appropriate to use a simplified revision procedure
~ secondly ] we agree to conduct new stress tests in the banking sector to ensure full transparency in the broader context of the % eu ] annual exercise
i need hardly remind you of the importance of proceeding as rapidly and as smoothly as possible in this matter in a period where market volatility remains a concern
! two ] other points concern work to be done by the member states and the institutions of the % european union ] together
and the summit with prime minister } singh ] of % india ] which showed good progress for an ambitious and balanced free trade agreement hopefully with a result in the @ first semester of this year ] and which also produced a joint declaration on international terrorism
this now requires an opinion from your ` parliament ] as well as from the ` european commission ] and the ` central bank ]
i insist all ! twenty seven ] agree even if the analysis focuses particularly on the current ! seventeen ] euro countries
the ` european council ] also decided to give % montenegro ] the status of candidate country
it foresees that the future ` european stability mechanism ] will be designed on the basis of the current mechanism so ` imf ] involvement is provided for
in @ march ] we will have our ~ first ] exercise of what is called the european semester
it underlines the conviction within the ` european council ] that the countries of the * western balkans ] have a ) european ] vocation
then the treaty amendment will have to be approved in each member state
concerning the role of the private sector decisions will be taken on a case by case basis so private sector involvement will not be a prior requirement for support under the future stability mechanism
i would like to thank president } buzek ] for his contribution on this at the ` european council ] and for informing us of ` parliament ] 's willingness to proceed quickly in considering this matter
} cathy ashton ] presented progress reports on how to deal with strategic partners and i briefed colleagues about the positive outcome of ! three ] recent summit meetings namely the summit with president } obama ] where we opened new avenues for transatlantic cooperation on growth jobs and security such as green growth and cyber security
the president of the ` central bank ] was also present and a statement by the heads of state or government of the * eurozone ] and the % eu ] institutions present was welcomed by the ` european council ]
it is important not just for legal certainty but also for market credibility
let me mention the elements of this joint approach which reflects the statement adopted
work is going on to develop these elements of this overall approach
i secured agreement on a text consisting of ! two ] sentences to be added to article ! one hundred and thirty six ] of the treaty
as simple as that and i wish it for you personally and i wish it for our % union ] in these difficult times
the granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality
~ first ] we decided on the proposal for a limited treaty amendment required to establish a permanent mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the * eurozone ] as a whole
at the @ december ] ` european council ] we focused on the ~ first ] day on economic issues and on the ~ second ] day on foreign policy
whatever internal discussions take place whether the financial facility will need to double its capital and the right to buy bonds whether the & financial stability mechanism ] after @ two thousand and thirteen ] will include trimming or will be ordered to sell eurobonds
regarding the ` financial stability mechanism ] the ` council ] 's decision says that the mechanism is to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the * eurozone ] as a whole
as history tells us people will deny the possibility of failure right up to the last moment
what we have had ever @ since two thousand and eight ] is repeated hesitation and internal wrangling between member states and the institutions and each time a painfully extracted response but produced too late and constituting less than what was required
what chance is there right now of a stronger and more democratic set of institutions emerging from a revised treaty
not only will it be exposed as economic lunacy but it will be profoundly damaging to the ) european ] project
mr president @ december ] 's ` european council ] at least gave us political agreement on a permanent crisis resolution mechanism but given the reaction of the markets @ after christmas ] with new fears over the solvency of % portugal ] % spain ] and % belgium ] we have to ask whether once again this was a case of too little too late
against this background i am shocked president } barroso ] at the frontal attack by the commission on social * europe ] and the interference with national labour markets as in the case of % ireland ] the annual growth survey is indeed a frontal attack on long established socially and economically essential workers rights and on the very concept of collective bargaining
what is holding the * eurozone ] together today is less the dream of the founding fathers than simply the nightmare of the alternative total collapse of the system
the abject failure to deal with the crisis is driving the ) european ] project into political deadlock
the proposed ) european ] stabilisation mechanism itself raised new questions on the financial markets and the existing financial stability mechanism is now regarded as insufficient
our institutional decision making processes are complex and lacking in democracy and our economic policy strategy is divided and ineffective the financial markets are not keeping the pressure on us just because of high debt and deficit levels president } barroso ] they are also doing so because they want compensation for the risk of lending money to a project that seems incapable of reaching maturity or fulfilling its own destiny
let us recognise the possibility of failure
intelligent calls for more political integration like that last week from the head of the ` german bundesbank ] really do not stand a chance
effectively we are introducing a genuine ) european ] dimension into national budgetary and economic policy making
@ this year ] we should see gdp growth at around
if the latter then there are a few things we are going to have to
that means investing in areas that derive growth unleashing the full potential of our single market increasing investment in energy transport and it infrastructure in part through innovative financing including we believe the % european union ] project bonds and continuing to press for a conclusion of the doha round while pushing forward free trade agreements with key partners
the final decisions on national budgets will of course be taken by national parliaments
in @ two thousand and twelve ] * europe ] 's manufacturing sector has improved markedly @ in recent months ]
let me just concentrate on that because i think based also on the very important conclusions of the @ december ] ` european council ] it is now more important than ever to look at the next steps
it is more than anything a matter of prioritising and some areas innovation education new forms of energy are good candidates for such priority treatment
the ~ third ] key message in the annual growth survey is to frontload and speed up measures that are growth enhancing
this is our new economic governance at work governance that should be the comprehensive response to the crisis
the annual growth survey launches this process and its key messages are clear bring back stability do not delay structural reforms any longer and speed up growth enhancing measures
we need to help people get back to work or find new jobs by making work more attractive
set if it is not us at ) european ] level who will encourage them to take those decisions who will do it only by sorting out our debt and stabilising finances can we move from crisis management to fostering growth not any kind of growth of course but sustainable inclusive
but we have to approach this in a sober and well thought out way
anyone who truly cares about a social * europe ] knows this cannot continue
citizens thank you for your attention
unless we balance the books we will not restore confidence in % europe ] 's economies
let me be quite clear structural reform does not mean reducing our level of social protection but it does mean bringing in those who are currently excluded from the labour market especially our young people
we cannot return to the old ways of doing
error the world has changed
it it is a matter of simple common sense and we are delivering it and will continue to deliver
ladies and gentlemen our economies are starting to move in the right direction
when we see the level of interdependence in the * euro area ] and the % european union ] as a whole a country should be able to take decisions knowing what its neighbours intend to
* europe ] 's next budget must be a growth enhancing budget
that is right and proper but this new form of economic governance simply reflects a rational response to a new reality
we should also see a steady improvement in employment prospects and we are starting to see public deficits decline thanks primarily to the consolidation measures already taken supported in some cases by a resumption of growth
fiscal consolidation does not mean reducing debt by taking a slash and burn approach to spending
in the face of increased international competition we can only sustain our social market economy if we adapt
it is bringing in genuine ) european ] economic governance
if we do not restore confidence we will risk economic stagnation and all the negative social consequences that flow from that especially for employment
levels of youth unemployment in some member states even in good times are a scandal
things if we do not act now in the face of the biggest crisis since the beginning of ) european ] integration when will member states be ready to take real steps for economic policies that are consistent with the goals they have themselves
do this sharing of information empowers and strengthens national parliaments
i believe a new reality is emerging the politics of economic governance and economic coordination have changed and this is not just because the so called ) federalists ] wanted
the ~ second ] key message from the annual growth survey is to push forward with structural reforms so that we can create new job opportunities the choice is a simple one do we want jobless growth or growth with jobs
our europe two thousand and twenty programme is central to this we must focus on measures that have clear economic benefits in the short to medium term and which lend themselves to relatively fast adoption
jobs the annual growth survey points the way so let us now commit seriously to proper economic policy coordination and real common ) european ] economic governance for all our
the commission has signalled this very clearly in the annual growth survey
~ first ] we need to re establish stability by consolidating public finances
we need to reform pension systems and make sure that the unemployed are not left worse off when they find work
growth that means structural reforms many of which we have been advocating @ for several years ] reforms that challenge all structures but do so to reduce prices and increase opportunities for new jobs and innovative ways of doing
this ex ante approach is at the heart of what makes this a historic step for the % european union ]
the recovery has taken hold and is currently progressing in the real economy
do we need to urge member states to focus @ this year ] on labour market reform so that we can remove obstacles to higher employment levels
all of this needs to be reflected in the next multiannual financial framework proposal
from now on we will be helping to shape policies upfront rather than assessing and trying to correct them afterwards
in particular the heads called for determined action in ensuring the availability of adequate financial support through the european financial stability facility pending the entry into force of the permanent mechanism
we were told that in a single currency member states would no longer be able to devalue their way out of trouble and would instead have to reform their economies to make them more competitive
the long term solution does not lie in bigger government
some member states were able to find other solutions to prop up their economies artificially through asset price inflation in part caused by an unsuitably low interest rate and a refusal to take corrective action by other means
whilst of course we must find solutions to deal with the immediate consequences of these policies and fiscal retrenchment is essential we must equally importantly commit ourselves to economic reform to extend labour market flexibility to create jobs to open markets and remove barriers to trade and to stimulate private investment so that we can fill the void left by reduced public sector spending
whilst we have been dealing with this immediate crisis other countries around the world some with political values that seem very different to our own have been forging ahead
if we do not come out of this crisis on a progressive path to reform we will be condemned to inexorable relative decline with the most profound consequences for the promotion of our values and indeed for the future of the planet
whilst a superficially attractive proposition many of us were right not to be taken in as this has proved a false prospectus
or by injecting borrowed public funds on an unsustainable scale and in some cases to cover up the size of the resulting fiscal deficit
mr president the ` european council ] took important decisions about the future management of crises but i agree with president } barroso ] that the underlying problems remain the need to return to fiscal discipline and the reluctance by some member states to pursue seriously economic reform
the financial and economic crisis made large scale government intervention in the economy unavoidable but we must not confuse the palliative with the cure
it lies in economic growth being generated by successful businesses and entrepreneurs operating in competitive markets which are able to deliver value to the consumer and create jobs for our citizens that is why the & europe two thousand and twenty strategy ] the & single market act ] and the & innovation union ] for example are so essential and must be given the attention they merit
they are under the control of % brussels ] and they are under the control of the international financial institutions
the decisions made by national electorates in these countries with regard to the spending priorities they adopt and the economic policies they pursue now have very little effect
once we get through this crisis we really need to look at restoring democracy in these countries and restoring the will of their national electorates to be in control of their own national economic policies
the situation is still very dire in a number of member states % portugal ] will almost certainly face difficulties possibly % spain ] and possibly % belgium ] but what is particularly of concern to me is the effect on natural democracy in these countries
these are not natural disasters and they were not beyond the control of the member states concerned
of % estonia ] 's membership of the * eurozone ] but % estonia ] has been preparing for this since its accession
) european ] citizens expect us to ease business making in the digital sphere where operations like electronic payments and e identification should be coherent and understandable
at a time of economic crisis moral values and ethics have become more important
this could be a real chance to boost ) european ] competitiveness in the world
well i think it is critically important that we have a strong response regarding stability of the euro
since we believe it is important to have a permanent stability mechanism the commission played a constructive role supporting this limited revision of the treaty
do it we should ask all member states that are in a more vulnerable position to do whatever they have to do to restore confidence in their economies through appropriate macro economic stability fiscal consolidation structural reforms
i believe the best way to support the courageous efforts that all of us are trying to make in * europe ] at different paces is to have the language of truth
with the * euro area ] now with ! seventeen ] member states and i very much welcome % estonia ] as a new member and with a process of decision making that is not always the simplest one in part because we are based on the principle of democracy
* europe ] is trying to support % ireland ] because it is important to know where the responsibility lies
since we want to reinforce stability i think it is important that we agree on this limited revision of the treaty
when * europe ] was financing your farmers after the war to feed your own people
we have ! twenty seven ] democracies
revision of the treaty you know what was the position of the commission
in * europe ] all the states have exactly the same dignity and those ideas of discriminating between member states are in fact very dangerous ideas for the ) european ] project
to the distinguished member of this parliament who comes from % ireland ] and asked a question suggesting that the problems of % ireland ] were created by * europe ] let me say the problems of % ireland ] were created by irresponsible financial behaviour by some ) irish ] institutions and by the lack of supervision in the ) irish ] market
another point which was made by some of you was what is the level of ambition
they were a minority but those comments were made trying to deepen divisions between ) europeans ] so called rich and so called poor ) europeans ]
that is why i want to appeal to all those who share the ) european ] ideal to not let us be distracted by what can be some differences of policy orientation mr } hughes ] i very much respect your concern with social * europe ] but let us be completely open about this
we are for the most ambitious position in terms of integrated response that is why the commission will be ready to support some of the measures that some of you have proposed
finally i think everybody has to make a contribution
this is the reality
this is critically important at this
moment we are not helping them if we are suggesting that they can escape that
what is the best way to support governments like the ) greek ] government the ) spanish ] government the ) portuguese ] government that are led by very distinguished members of our political family is it to support the reforms they are taking courageously or to say simply that those reforms are against ) european ] values we
this is why it is important to those of us and this is clearly the majority that believe in ) european ] ideals that we are able to have as much as possible a common response
some of us would like to go further i personally would like to go further in terms of the structuring and the deepening of the community approach
so we need stronger governance in the euro area we need stronger economic policy coordination in the % european union ] as a whole and basically we should all of us commit to the principles of solidarity and responsibility it is not just a question of responsibility
once again let me make clear the position of the commission
that is why i want to state again that some of the proposals which were put forward are indeed themselves interesting ones but they are not able at this moment to generate the necessary consensus and the commission has to be very attentive to the contribution it gives to forging this consensus
! one ] thing i want to say to you and it is clearly a huge majority that shares ) european ] ideals and need to have a ) european ] response is that we should not be divided by some differences that are not the most important ones
so i think it would be a complete mistake now to be divided on this matter
where were you when * europe ] was financing your infrastructures for the development and competitiveness of your countries
where were you when * europe ] was the basis for the prosperity and growth of your countries after the war
so how should we
in the current world of competition with the pressure of some stronger emerging economies now either we adapt or we will be putting at risk our social market economy
them at the same time those countries that are now in a better position should show solidarity with those countries as
it is a mechanism to make working class people throughout * europe ] pay for the crisis of a broken financial system and a crisis ridden ) european ] capitalism
mr } barroso ] and mr } van rompuy ] tell me > this morning ] because you have not done so yet about the morality of transferring ( tens of billions of euro ] of private bad debts by speculators and bankers gambled wildly on the ) irish ] property market and placing those debts on the shoulders of the ) irish ] people who carry no responsibility whatsoever for them
you are destroying our services and the living standards of our people
you claim to be ) democrats ] but you enslave the working people of * europe ] to the markets the financial markets which lead you around by the nose
your financial stability mechanism is a vicious weapon dictated by the markets masquerading as something benign
if you go back through history you find that when people are put together in false currency unions when governments think they know better than the markets governments always lose
% greece ] % portugal ] and % ireland ] do not fit inside the euro
what we should be doing what mr } van rompuy ] should be doing in order to give real leadership is to be introducing a plan b and to allow these countries to go back to their own currency to have competitive devaluations and to have a chance because what we are doing with this policy is killing them off
that was @ last july ] on the amendments to the & tobacco products directive ] and in particular on electronic cigarettes
there is something rotten at the heart of ` coventry city council ]
it only came to light when the trial against a man accused of the # london hyde park bombing ] collapsed because he had such a letter preventing him from prosecution
mr president in my constituency of % northern ireland ] we have an outrageous situation where the previous ) labour ] government of } tony blair ] introduced a secret scheme offering so called comfort letters to ` ira ] terrorists known as on the runs
the truth about a process which circumvented the ` uk parliament ] and undermined the justice system must be exposed
on this # european day for victims of terrorism ] the truth and
there is no evidence to demonstrate that knowledge of the process went beyond a clique of ) republicans ] their confidants and the government
the first minister in % northern ireland ] has forced a judge led enquiry into this scheme the coalition government has stated that this scheme is over and will ensure that letters cannot be relied upon to avoid prosecution
whilst we all follow current events we must not forget the events of the past that are still being played out
and whilst we talk about humanity let us not forget the ! fifty two ] refugees murdered on @ one september two thousand and thirteen ] while protecting * camp ashraf ] and the missing ! seven ] innocent refugees including ! six ] women who were taken hostage
mr president the tragic developments in % ukraine ] and the horrors of % syria ] are just a few of the more recent events that need to be seen not only in political terms but in terms of human tragedy
is this the civilised world we live in
as minister with responsibility for the * gaeltacht ] i was directly involved in the design of the ~ first ] pilot leader programme in % ireland ]
i strongly urge the minister and the government to provide this necessary funding
finally i call on the minister even at this late stage to reconsider
moreover an interim fund is required to bridge the gap between the current and the next round of leader funds
mr president the totalitarian policies of the % democratic people 's republic of korea ] which have been used to oppress its citizens for over @ sixty years ] have led to a great number of ) north koreans ] fleeing to the % people 's republic of china ]
the % european union ] must resolutely condemn this atrocious practice and raise it at all % eu ] % china ] high level talks among the other human rights violations that have been repeatedly underlined by the ` european parliament ]
this is an issue on which the % eu ] has for many years spoken out and played an active role both at the ` united nations ] and in our bilateral dialogue with the ` dprk government ]
the % eu ] is seriously concerned about the forcible repatriation of ) north korean ] asylum seekers and refugees
therefore the % eu ] has been raising this issue with % china ] in particular in the framework of the # eu china human rights dialogue ]
the % european union ] as a global political actor will continue to follow all aspects of the situation on the peninsula working in close collaboration with its various strategic partners
following the death of } kim jong il ] in @ december ] and the purported satellite launch in @ april ] the focus in @ recent months ] has been heavily on the political succession in the % dprk ] and on regional security issues
this is @ less than a week from now ]
under these texts adhering countries have specifically obliged themselves to refrain from returning people to their country of origin in cases where they might face the death penalty or torture an obligation that already exists in general under customary international law
we will continue to use every occasion to persuade the ) chinese ] authorities to change this assessment
however we should not lose sight of the appalling human rights situation within the country
their predicament is double because ~ first ] of all their vulnerability is immense
they normally come from indescribable material conditions and when they make it to another country and indeed % china ] is the only option available in most cases they have probably been in unspeakable distress for a long time and should they return or be returned which is one of the problems that we address in the current resolution
the resolution is specifically about refugees we are talking about ! thousands ] and ! thousands ] of people who have had no other choice but to flee their country because they do not even have anything to eat or to drink where they come from and they are often treated by % china ] which is the country that hosts most of them in a way that is not exactly as we would want it to be
for example in education the minister spoke about education at the meeting of the education ministers
action we need action in the sense of growth policy by investment with action for employment including action from the ) european ]
because that is where the policy originates ably assisted by some member states
the commissioner for human rights from the ` council of europe ] in his report on safeguarding human rights in times of economic crisis said that most austerity measures have exacerbated the already severe human consequences of the economic crisis and that vulnerable and marginalised groups have been disproportionately hit
yes deficits have been reduced but debts mount
and ! eighty ] so without significant growth those debt figures that i spoke of become overwhelming and how can we have growth if we do not have targeted investments
they are not some afterthought to be taken into consideration when the economic issues are dealt with
if you take the general government gross debt and consolidated private debt that total debt as a percentage of gdp is a staggering ! four hundred ]
last night in this ` parliament ] i spoke of ` eurostat ] figures from @ two thousand and twelve ] and my own country % ireland ]
that is why in my opinion social indicators are just as valid as economic ones and in my view they should be binding in our employment report we added additional indicators such as child poverty levels access to health care homelessness and a decent work index
these are not just words they describe the lives of real people and i would say to } mrbarroso ] who i think is no longer with us that yes some small progress has been made but for many countries it is not a sustainable model
in my own country an assessment of the last ! five ] budgets showed that the hardest hit by those budgetary policies are the very rich and the very poor
are we saying to those countries tough get used to it the crisis will continue the grinding scraping along the bottom that we call progress will continue
i only hope that commissioner } andor ] sitting behind him is actually listening because of course his ` unemployment department ] is doing more to make employing people and actually creating more jobs in * europe ] as difficult as possible
the debate is already beginning to shift away from protectionism away from higher spending and an endless stream of red tape and towards open markets better spending and cutting back on regulation
! one three million ] more jobs and unemployment is falling sharply
unemployment is at a @ sixteen year ] high taxes have sent wealth abroad and social welfare spending is now the highest in the ` oecd ]
the economy is not secure but it is going in the right direction
that is why the parties certainly in my group will offer an agenda for the % eu ] that mirrors the reforms being taken in many of our member states to deliver investment and infrastructure instead of wasteful spending to deliver deregulation and decentralisation instead of interference and to open up trade and the single market instead of creating more barriers to business
surely the experience of @ recent years ] shows us that when countries do tighten their belts spend to invest and restructure their economies we begin to see the benefits
my ) conservative ] led government in % britain ] has stuck with its long term plan to pay down the deficit to incite the productive parts of the economy and to reform our welfare system
yet many on the left as } mrswoboda ] exemplified > this morning ] are still arguing for more state spending and more centralisation of power
you are still perpetuating the falsehood that states can somehow create jobs or that politicians can somehow legislate to create more employment
much as i enjoyed the minister 's speech > this morning ] i have to say that there is something deeply ironic about a minister from % greece ] coming here to argue with us and tell us how to reduce youth unemployment
as a result the economy is now growing faster than any other major ) european ] economy there are
we are certainly seeing that in my own country
or as it so often does to actually hinder it
we are proud to have begun that debate about taking the % eu ] in a new direction away from its socialist and centralising past
president } hollande ] promised us all an end to austerity but he has actually been mugged by reality because the only way to end austerity is to implement the tough reforms that encourage investment and grow the economy at % eu ] level those lessons are starting to apply as well
if we compare that to ) socialist ] % france ] public spending there is now equivalent to ! fifty six ] of national income the ~ second ] highest in the * euro area ]
for those of us who want to see state spending controlled the worst possible thing you could do is to give the % eu ] new powers to raise its own revenue through new own resources
i understand that @ this afternoon ] } mrschulz ] and } mrbarroso ] will join with prime minister } samaras ] and } mrmonti ] to launch the new ` high level group ] on own resources
the ) european ] semester has been instrumental in driving the necessary structural reforms in the member states and raising these reform goals to the political agenda
therefore we cannot be complacent
i very much appreciate and commend the efforts of % greece ] to restore economic growth and job creation under very difficult circumstances and following decades of economic and policy mismanagement i have to say that i find
and by investing in sustainable green growth and turning innovations in that field into competitive products and services that is into new businesses and new jobs for ) europeans ]
my report and the report by } mrgutirrez prieto ] start this process and provide a clear path forward a combination of more democratic accountability a combination of solidarity with conditionality and clear responsibilities and also more room for private investment to boost investment and to improve entrepreneurship and create jobs and growth these reforms are not of course always pleasant but it is also our job as politicians to have the courage to defend the road taken and the benefits it will bring in the long
i think that we as the ` european parliament ] should take up our role in this process much more maybe than we do today we have of course after the very difficult economic situation taken a road ahead also supported by this ` parliament ] a road of reducing deficits and balancing budgets a road of implementing economic reform a road of modernising social protection but also a road of investing in education research and development we cannot go back and restore the mistakes which were made at the start and the onset of the creation of the euro but i do feel that we must do our utmost and maybe it is the task of our generation to make sure that we correct the mistakes and take a clear path forward
at the ) european ] level we have seen a coalition of civil society organisations working very hard over the @ last few years ] to gain a meaningful role and with some success but we need to see this embedded structurally into this whole process at national level
i would really like to ask their representatives here whether they are going to take action on the issue and start negotiating such an agreement or not
it is also clear that if we want the eu two thousand and twenty process the semester to have democratic legitimacy we need to involve civil society and social partners much more strongly
too in the % uk ] we have seen civil society social partners really squeezed out of the process since the change from the past coordination method
debt but we still have great challenges ahead
but we have to solve the problems of over indebtedness and lack of competitiveness
the best rules are of no use if there is no strong referee to implement them
rather we must step up our ambition because we have to continue with determination this house has negotiated many important proposals in @ the past years ] and @ months ]
we are aware of the great challenges that the ) cypriot ] government is facing let us not forget that many of them have only inherited the extremely difficult problems in their countries
therefore we have to unleash the investment potential but we also have to step up our efforts for structural reforms with great ambitions
we have not yet left the crisis fully behind us
current accounts are improving and after @ eighteen months ] of stagnation growth has been picking up since early
however thanks to joint and concerted efforts we have overcome its most critical part
look at what happens in countries like % france ] and % italy ]
they have shown courage and accepted the responsibility which voters entrusted in them
the structural reforms are sometimes painful and we should never forget how many ) europeans ] are hit very hard without having the slightest responsibility for the problems of the past
@ today ] 's debate is the occasion to look at our member states and pay tribute to the efforts many courageous women and men have made the reforms for instance carried out by the ) portuguese ] the ) spanish ] the ) irish ] and the ) greek ] governments deserve our respect
it will help to stabilise our economies and stimulate growth and on behalf of the ` epp ] i would like to thank president } barroso ] and vice president } rehn ] for the determination the determination of your commission which you have shown
* europe ] has been in good hands and the ` epp ] also fully supports your approach in the @ two thousand and fourteen ] semester our group wants a strong commission an independent commission
we have to beat the unacceptable unemployment figures
we have to think of the future of our children their jobs and their future delaying reforms would cause even more hardship therefore i am sure we are laying the right foundations to give young ) europeans ] a brighter future and offer them jobs instead of
let me remind this house also that in the economic field there are binding tools backed by sanctions in the social field we still largely rely on the open method of coordination
we have discussed the issues which are in the forefront of citizens minds public services wages unemployment poverty and education these are issues of concern to all of us since they affect all our citizens irrespective of their home country
there is also the & youth guarantee implementation plan ]
there is still a lot to do
how can we make our economy recover again
we also significantly reformed our financial sector from new capital requirements to more recently the proposal on the structural reform of banks
past i think we can say that the need for sound public finances is now entrenched
we were able to provide financial assistance to member states in distress or in some cases specifically to their banking sector
@ two thousand and fifteen ] consumer confidence and investment confidence is now positive
by cutting red tape and reducing regulatory burdens
along with national parliaments you have brought democratic legitimacy accountability and ownership as we said @ last year ] in the blueprint for a deep and genuine economic and monetary union economic governance social commitments and democratic legitimacy must move forward hand in
smes tax systems should be simplified further and the tax burden redirected away from labour we should be more resource and energy efficient and invest more in research innovation and development because we cannot afford to sit back and
instead of expressing concern leaders outside * europe ] congratulate us on our resilience and for our political willingness to act
today we should continue to look at ways to be more competitive by making further progress on the single market and adopting the remaining proposals under & single market act i ] and ii in telecoms transport energy and the digital
i think we can say that this was a strong set of achievements which were possible due to the strong involvement of this house
naturally we know the situation is still difficult
a reinforced surveillance of employment and social developments is now a reality as part and parcel of the ) european ] semester
but more important than the process is that it has led to concrete and significant fiscal and structural reforms that have helped restore confidence
our ~ number one ] priority was to stop the bloodshed and create the conditions for a political process that can deliver what the ) ukrainian ] people most wish for democracy respect for fundamental freedoms and a better prospect for the country 's future
i launch from here an appeal to all our international partners and in particular % russia ] to work constructively with us to guarantee a united % ukraine ] that can be effective for stability in the * european continent ] a % ukraine ] that will have good relations both with its western and its eastern partners
to say a few words about the situation in that ) european ] country which we feel is so close to us now
we are already working together with the international community and international financial institutions to find ways to support the country
a lasting solution to the political and institutional crisis can only be achieved through an inclusive transitional government that respects the different political and regional sensitivities and through constitutional reform and democratic elections as laid down in the agreement of @ twenty one february ]
the ) european ] semester goes to the very heart of what has preoccupied us all especially from the outset of the financial crisis our economy
area by putting in place a system of increased coordination i think * europe ] has shown that there was a will and there is in fact a will to learn the lessons from the crisis and to avoid some of the mistakes of the
potential we must now get down to the business of extracting the biggest added value from every last euro that has been
it has added a strong economic dimension to a range of policies from taxation energy transport research climate and environment to judicial systems
these renewed foundations were laid down in just a @ few years ] and they play a key role in helping * europe ] emerge from the crisis more resilient for the future and stronger
while some of us would have liked to go further and faster i believe it is fair to recognise progress in this area
it is true that improvements in macroeconomic conditions are not yet being felt by citizens themselves and by their families in some of our member states
they also congratulate us on the necessary courageous and often painful reforms that several member states have had to put in place
have been together we are emerging from the crisis united open and i believe
@ a year ago ] some were still talking of the collapse of the euro some were even speculating about the disintegration of the % european union ] i think we can say that together we have proved that the prophets of doom were wrong
deficits have been halved and significant structural reforms for more competitiveness are under way reforms such as the modernisation of our labour markets and public administrations or the youth guarantees that are being put in place to ensure that all young people under @ twenty five ] receive a good quality offer of employment continued education an apprenticeship or a traineeship within @ four months ] of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed
this is the year in which we are moving away from recession the recovery is expected to continue and to become more robust during @ this year ] and to strengthen further in
but at the same time it would be politically inaccurate and i think intellectually dishonest to deny the progress we have made
sector by getting rid of the blockages in business and professional services retail and construction
tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis will take time and resolve
and by improving access to finance for our
we are about to conclude and i certainly expect the strong support of ` parliament ] on this the ` banking union ] which is a significant step in the deepening of ` economic and monetary union ] and finally we have overhauled the system of economic governance in the % european union ] particularly in the * euro area ]
by introducing the ) european ] semester we have ensured that coordination of member state economic policies takes place at ) european ] level respecting of course the national competences
this ` parliament ] passed a resolution with a large majority in favour
by giving us a programme for the digital single market
so that is the big message from my committee which i hope will be taken on board
i was very pleased that mr } kourkoulas ] and mr } barroso ] i am sorry he is still not here both included in their speeches explicit references to the potential of the single market and areas that need to be moved forward in order to create the jobs and growth that we all seek
i just want to supplement this by saying in particular to the commission to } mrbarroso ] that we already gave you the instruments by approving in this ` parliament ] the single market acts which were not in your original europe two thousand and twenty programme because we wanted a political programme to complete the key instruments of the single market so why are you not following those through properly in this semester why are you not taking the lead from this ` parliament ]
the ` council ] asked you for it
where is the commission 's programme on this key growth instrument
but even if you had they would not have listened so obsessed are they with building the euro ok a simple lesson in economics when you have ! two ] countries that are at completely different stages of the economic cycle ! one ] currency needs to devalue
what you could have told them } mrkourkoulas ] is that according to the respected medical journal ` the lancet ] there are now ! eight hundred thousand ] people in % greece ] without access to welfare or medical care
but if those countries are pegged or tied inside the same currency and they cannot devalue you have to devalue the country and that is what is happening to the * mediterranean ] we are devaluing the * mediterranean ] and it is leaning towards ~ third ] world status
the obsession that you will use the crisis to build a united states of europe
however the taxpayers in % london ] do not object strongly to transfers going to % newcastle ] or % scotland ] or wherever they may be needed because we are part of the same country the problem you have with the * euro area ] is not just this huge economic imbalance between north and south but that increasingly the taxpayers of the north do not want to go on subsidising the south because there is no sense of ) european ] identity
we are very different countries
what happens in practice is that ) conservative ] centre right policies are actually delivering the agenda that we all want to see
of course the ) socialists ] and the ) greens ] can talk a good story can talk about concern and compassion but the results on the ground show that their policies are misguided and on the ground do not actually deliver any results
mr } lamberts ] it is all very well for you as a ) green ] mep to say that it is a disaster that people are finding the cost of living so high yet it is your ) green ] policies ~ firstly ] not allowing gm crops to be grown properly in * europe ] which would make food cheaper and ~ secondly ] your crazy energy policies which are raising the price of energy to every single household
mr } farage ] i think that many things you said make a lot of sense internal devaluation in a currency union is inevitable if there are no transfers now would you then applying the same reasoning to the % united kingdom ] say that if the economic cycles of % wales ] of % scotland ] or of % northern ireland ] are different then probably the best solution would be to dissolve the currency union and to then leave each part of the current union to live its own life possibly with
we do have the capability to invest
then the question is how do you correct the impact of these measures on those at the lowest end of the income spectrum via ambitious tax policies that is what we need to change
what the commission said has helped to rebuild confidence and what the member states and the commission have done despite the negativity has restored stability and confidence
let us be clear about that message
~ secondly ] i have heard a great deal about jobs and growth but we are missing a key word here
in % ireland ] we had jobs and growth to beat the band during the # celtic tiger ] era but it was unsustainable
let us talk about sustainable jobs and growth my ~ third ] point let us talk about spending money cuts etc
we have wasted money
we have thrown money at problems
we need quality spending of member states budgets just as we need quality spending of the % european union ] 's budget
it has been the lack of structural reforms that has created unemployment and deep social problems
we all know that the policy of spendarity which is advocated from that side has led to ever growing costs for interest rates squeezing out important spending on welfare and important investments in infrastructure
yet still some of the colleagues here are defending more spending more deficits higher interest rates more cost for interest rates but every step which is taken in that direction undermines prosperity and competitiveness what we see now
spending or spendarity caused high unemployment and high interest rates and undermined public finances
over ! twenty ] ! zero ] elephants were killed by poachers @ last year ]
this marks an important step in the protection of highly endangered species around the world
but the trade in living wild animals is also thriving
these animals face extreme stress poor conditions and are at a high risk of early death
we can and must develop an action plan working closely with countries such as % china ]
they deserve our protection
the % eu ] can be a global leader in the fight against this serious and most profitable crime as a full member of ` cites ]
all parties to & cites ] must act decisively and quickly to prevent animals being traded as commodities
at this very moment the % zimbabwe ] government is profiteering from baby elephants removed from their herds to be sold to zoos in % china ] and the % uae ]
we will also be responsible for implementing and enforcing the convention and will participate fully in & cites ] projects
a record ! six hundred and sixty eight ] rhinos in % south africa ] alone were killed for their horns just to make trinkets and medicines that do not work unless we act now these species and many others will become extinct
more than ever international coordinated action is needed to end illegal wildlife trade stop poaching and the increasing rate of biodiversity loss
barely @ a week ] goes by when we do not see some new seizure of goods or medicines fashioned from endangered species from tigers bones to rhino horn
i would like to see this as just the very beginning of the % eu ] 's new approach to & cites ]
in my view this will give the % eu ] a platform to move forward together at the conference of the parties employing the power and influence of all ! twenty eight ] member states together and i hope that in the near future we will be able to use this influence to promote tougher enforcement of the licensing system
we must reinvest in natural capital construct green infrastructure and ensure that all spending under the % eu ] budget is supportive of halting the loss of biodiversity
on the specific question raised here @ today ] on the & eu action plan against wildlife trafficking ] we have taken good note of the ` parliament ] resolution on wildlife trafficking and the recent letter signed by ! eighty one ] meps arguing in favour of an % eu ] wildlife action plan
the % eu ] voice will be stronger in an international arena
and the ` conference of the parties ] later the @ same year ]
as commissioner } vella ] has already indicated the % eu ] should be leading the fight against wildlife trafficking both domestically and internationally
madam president honourable members we are grateful to hear the strong support of ` parliament ] for the upcoming % eu ] accession to & cites ] with the prospect of ` parliament ] giving its consent to the ` council ] decision tomorrow the % eu ] should finally be able to become a party to & cites ] @ next year ] and be ready for the next meeting of the ` cites standing committee ] in @ january two thousand and sixteen ]
thank you for your support
like the elephant if it has ever more characteristics of a sovereign state then it is obvious to all that this is exactly what the % eu ] is becoming
it will enable the commission to lead negotiations and be a catalyst
the % eu ] acquires the ! one ] vote counting as ! twenty eight ] votes and my country along with ! twenty seven ] others lose yet another freedom to decide for themselves
the usual weasel words are in the report
there are those especially in the % uk ] who are in denial about this fact that the % european union ] as a direct inevitable consequence of the commitment to ever closer union and as set out in successive treaties is taking over the sovereignty of member states
the impact that losses like these have on ecosystems is catastrophic
one cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of this illegal trade is carried out in the developing world in conflict zones
if annual turnover for the illegal trade is estimated to be ( usd nineteen billion ] making it the ~ fourth ] largest illegal trade in the world the extreme poverty of many ) african ] communities lends itself to this trade
when the tusks of a single adult elephant are worth more than ! ten ] times the average annual income in many of these countries is it any wonder that impoverished people resort to wildlife trade
the % eu ] of course should support these countries where they lack equipment and funds for enforcement but we must also look at the bigger picture
the % european union ] cannot be found wanting in its actions and it cannot allow species like the ) african ] elephant and rhino to be consigned to the history books
the % eu ] and member states must of course comply with obligations under this convention but it is one thing to ban or limit trade and it is another to effectively enforce it
! ninety five ] of the world 's rhinos have been wiped out in the @ last forty years ] and let us also not forget all the other less well known species that are illegally traded on a daily basis
& cites ] has recently engaged much more in regulating international trade in marine and timber species
these are also areas in which the % eu ] has strong legislation and policies
at its last meeting in @ july ] the ` cites standing committee ] adopted very concrete measures targeting the countries most involved in wildlife trafficking particularly in ivory rhino horns and rosewood
to conclude i would stress that the % eu ] 's accession to & cites ] will reinforce both the % eu ] as a global player and & cites ] as an essential multilateral instrument for sustainable development the commission is aware of the interest of ` parliament ] in these matters and we count on your support
however the % eu ] will gain visibility at the & cites ] meetings as % eu ] positions will be expressed by the % eu ] on matters of % eu ] competence the % eu ] will also be able to participate fully in the various bodies set up under the & convention ] and contribute to its @ annual ] budget
the situation will be similar to the other organisations such as the ` wto ] the ` fao ] or the ` convention on biological diversity ] of which the % eu ] has been a full member @ for many years ]
medicines cosmetics and food products
when presenting these political guidelines to ` parliament ] in @ july ] president } juncker ] made clear that one of the aims of the new commission is to reinforce the % eu ] as a strong global actor the % eu ] accession to the & cites convention ] is to be seen in this context
this wide scope combined with the legally binding nature of its decisions and its robust compliance mechanism makes the & cites convention ] a critical tool to address the overexploitation of natural resources which is ! one ] of the biggest threats to biodiversity today
these are all areas in which the % eu ] is a leading actor on the international scene
the & cites convention ] stands at the crossroads of environment trade and development
the & cites convention ] aims to make international trade in wildlife species sustainable it is a very operational and efficient instrument that regulates ! millions ] of cross border movements of animals plants and commodities derived from them such as timber leather goods
in operational terms the way we prepare for & cites ] meetings will not change much after the % eu ] accession as there is a well established practice to agree on common % eu ] positions before each meeting
these measures need to be implemented within strict deadlines and failure to do so could result in the adoption of trade sanctions increasingly ` cites ] is also engaging in close cooperation with international organisations like the ` un office on drugs and crime ] and ` interpol ] which also
the current dramatic surge in wildlife trafficking calls for a strong response from the international community
& cites ] is also at the forefront of the fight against wildlife trafficking a problem which i know is important to this ` parliament ]
these are very valuable commodities traded in large amounts
the % eu ] 's accession to the convention will reflect its leading role and it will increase the % eu ] 's visibility and accountability
madam president it is a sad reflection on mankind that we can put a man on the moon but we are not capable of keeping some of our most valuable animals alive on earth
we give the highest financial value to those commodities that are scarcest on earth but sadly that logic applies to animals as well even to the point that the rarer a species becomes the more sought after and the more valuable it or its body parts become
it is now the stroke of midnight for a number of the world 's most endangered species
however there is still time but only if mankind can work together to get a message to all cultures on earth that we cannot go on like this to outlaw the immoral trade in animal products from rare species and to urge all authorities to join in enforcement
i commend & cites ] and i welcome the accession of the % eu ]
we did not speak with one voice we were not very united we were more occupied by our internal negotiations as % eu ] member states and then we made a strong position at the conference itself so i am very relieved that we have finally become a party to & cites ]
another thing i would like to address here and the commissioner has already mentioned it as have many of my colleagues is the importance of the fight against wildlife trafficking that is something that should be done with & cites ] but of course and the commission knows this this is something that should also be done much more strongly
i therefore hope that commissioner } moedas ] can give the message not only to his colleague responsible for the environment but also to his colleagues higher up the hierarchy in the commission that we really need an % eu ] action plan against wildlife trafficking and the sooner the better
issues relating to & cites ] have a crucial impact on % eu ] policy in a great number of areas wildlife trafficking for example is not only unethical because of the harm it causes to animals but is also depriving local communities of sustainable development opportunities robbing countries of potential tax revenues deterring investment providing financing to terrorist groups and enabling the spread of diseases like ebola
so i strongly believe that the % eu ] should take a leadership role in & cites ] in putting a stop to the trafficking of tigers and all other endangered species
and i recall in the # last parliament ] when i was here the impact of the save the tiger conference and exhibitions which i held here
therefore packaging techniques such as modified atmosphere packaging and innovations such as active and intelligent packaging can ameliorate this my party and i therefore believe that plastic packaging which cannot be reused should be made of a substance that can be recycled
madam president my party and i strongly value products materials and resources in our economy and we believe that these should be kept in use for as long as possible in order to minimise the generation of waste in our environment
however food packaging has led to a reduction in food wastage
and as far as packaging is concerned we will be extremely ambitious and we will come up with legislation and we want this to happen very quickly
they know they need to be part of this
how are we going to deal with micro plastics coming out of tyres on cars or coming out of our clothes when we wash them
but let me give you ! one ] guarantee this commission will try everything it can to put on your table legislative proposals in those areas where we can come up with legislation
this is what we will do and this is a promise i make on behalf of all of us we will make proposals for legislation where we can
but i have the feeling that given the sense of urgency that is shared by industry we will be able to do a lot of things together as well
but we will not rush into things especially if we haven 't got the science right yet or if we can still wait for industry to do its part
@ two thousand and twenty ] so i see the message you gave to us @ today ] as a strong endorsement for this commission to continue along this path
plastics can be fantastic if they 're the right plastics and we need to get the science right
these are complicated things and we want to make sure we get the science right before we put legislation on the table
we 've already started with & reach ] on micro plastics in cosmetics paints and in detergents but sometimes we need more analysis
but we 've also seen that the unity of purpose in this room is shared by industry by and large they want to be part of this
everyone agrees that we need to do something perhaps not everyone agrees on the measures we need to take or the speed with which we will do it
that creates a complete economic value chain giving the industry the possibility to adapt to the new rules moreover while taking into account food safety we need to discourage multi layer packaging and encourage easier to recycle plastics
that is why i welcomed the proposal for quality standards for recycled plastics and the intention to incentivise packaging for the construction and car industries to use more of them
we can and should have more ambition when it comes to micro plastics in detergents in detergents and cosmetics and single use plastics by building on the success of our legislation on plastic bags
we have an immediate concern around illegal dumping i took a walk in the countryside at the @ weekend ] and i was disgusted with what i saw around me
there is ! one ] area where we are encouraging people to use the internet to buy goods and services however when it comes to buying products we all know that the amount of packaging that comes through our post or otherwise with internet sales is enormous and we are not talking about it
this is something we 've got to talk about and deal with or the mountains will rise
that 's the good news
the bad news is that my country is one of the largest producers of plastic waste in the % european union ] so we 've got a lot of work to do we need to talk about % china ] and its decision not to take our dirty plastic anymore i 've tried to find out from the industry where it is going to go i wonder do the commissioners know
it seems to me that we 're moving from landfills to sea fills and that 's really serious because of the impact on our ecosystems
it has got to work
a ) french ] colleague saw my pictures on ` twitter ] and shared her experiences so we need to tackle that in the member states
my young children buy things on the internet and i have more waste as a result
there is a tide of growing awareness and concern among people businesses and governments about the enormity of plastic pollution
the package the commission adopted @ yesterday ] keeps us on this very positive track
every second approximately < seven hundred kilos ] of plastic waste ends up in our oceans if we go on this way there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by
we need the full support of this ` parliament ] if we are to be successful
single use plastic items constitute ! fifty ] of litter found on % eu ] beaches and it is important that we significantly reduce the use of these products
also we will continue our work to ban oxo plastics because these oxo plastics fragment to tiny pieces exacerbating the micro plastics accumulation even more
@ two thousand and fifty ] micro plastics are found not just in our oceans but also in our water in the water we drink in the food we eat and in the air we breathe also the way we produce use and dispose of plastics today is a threat to several economic sectors fisheries and tourism to name ! two ]
in the shorter term we need to curb plastic waste and reduce the use of certain types of plastic
it is therefore paramount that we address packaging as a priority our aim is that by @ two thousand and thirty ] all plastic packaging placed on the % eu ] market will be reusable or recyclable in a cost effective manner
we will also develop additional measures to motivate those working on boats to bring the fishing gear to land and not dump it into the sea
since a significant part of plastic pollution comes from other parts of the world we will need to work together with the rest of the world to make sure that we improve the situation
together with this strategy we adopted a new directive on port reception facilities which goes a long way ensuring that waste is brought back to land instead of being discharged at sea
with this strategy we aim to foster a new sustainable and profitable plastics economy with the design of products and other parts of the production chain taking into account re use and recycling needs plastic packaging accounts for about ! sixty ] of all plastic waste generated in * europe ] every year
we have been a global leader on climate action and we can be a global leader here as well
micro plastics are another serious problem
we have launched a process to ban micro plastics that are intentionally added to products such as cosmetics paints and detergents and we can do that under the & reach ] framework
in @ last year ] 's special eurobarometer survey ! eighty four ] of ) european ] citizens said that they are worried about the impact of plastics on our environment
the main element of this package is the plastics strategy for * europe ]
it often seems to be forgotten that high levels of plastic recycling can only be achieved by improving the way plastics are produced and designed
and if we manage to set things right the world will follow us it is always the case that good ) european ] policies are copied elsewhere and that should be our goal to have a global impact
but plastic waste reduction depends not only on the recycling infrastructure it can also be reduced by using more sustainable materials which could replace traditional plastic while offering the same functionalities
in the % eu ] the uptake of recycled plastics in new products is low
the intention is to stimulate investment in the sector
plastics packaging today accounts for about ! sixty ] of all plastics waste generated in * europe ] every year
according to the estimates only ! five ] of the value of plastic packaging materials remains in the economy the rest goes to waste after a very short ~ first ] use
the aim is that by @ two thousand and thirty ] all plastic packaging will be reusable and recyclable this will be achieved by stimulating design for circularity boosting recycled content and stimulating better separate waste collection
it is therefore paramount that we address this as a priority
in other words our aim is ~ first ] to create a truly well functioning single market for recyclable plastics ~ second ] to improve waste collection and ~ third ] promote recycled plastics
only around
this will create trust in the market and attract further investment and innovation in * europe ]
later @ this year ] the commission will develop a strategic research innovation agenda for plastics
the annual bill accounts for up to ( eur one hundred and five billion ]
this debate made me really happy and i do believe that we can deliver
it 's actually a good incentive for * europe ] to find solutions sustainable solutions how to deal with plastic waste it puts pressure on us but it also create incentives
i must congratulate them
but even more money is available in private sector if the regulatory environment is right and that 's why we have to concentrate on this part of our work ~ fourthly ] on % china ] i must say that i could not blame % china ] at all when they decided to
it will change the market and this is what we need a sustainable market where profit is coming from more sustainable behaviour
so we have to encourage or empower consumers
if you are as old as i am you can remember when there was not very much plastic around and life was very different
perhaps given where i stand in the chamber and possibly a little bit my nationality it will not come as a great surprise to you that i am not such a fan as the two previous speakers of the legislation
that is not to say that i do not think we need any of course we do we do need a framework but i would like to make an appeal for that to be as light as possible in the sense of setting member states targets and allowing them to use their own best efforts to meet those
i can tell you that in the % uk ] where we have just banned microplastics there was no resistance
it is actually the functioning of the whole system that needs to be taken very seriously so i thank you very much
i have spoken to both of you and i have to say i am satisfied that for the first time ever we are looking at the issue with a holistic perspective
it could be that i come from an island in the middle of the * mediterranean ] and that makes me much more aware of the environmental and health problems that plastic waste brings i think this is our opportunity to actually make sure that we put environment at the forefront while also making sure that we get industry on board
we need to make sure that we remain competitive and we do not let other continents run in front of us in the competitiveness stakes
this is our opportunity because people are aware of the impact that plastic has not only on our environment but also on our health
so it is great to see that commitment from the commission and leafing through the strategy i must say the analysis is very strong the language is right and the intentions are very very promising
not only that it is the only political body that can propose legislative proposals
i know some elements are technically difficult setting common standards for biodegradable plastics is not easy and i know there 's a huge scientific debate behind that
but there are many other elements that are much less complicated and that have already been considered by the commission for years and years even by previous commissioners
that has been done the around the world so concluding i 'm very happy with the strategy but i had expected a little bit more on the legislative part i know that your intention is to come forward with those please do so during your mandate because if it is left to the next commission we don 't know if the same ! two ] vice presidents will still be still there
i just want to mention ! two ] issues
on faith schools i fully support the right of parents to have their children educated within the principles of a particular faith so long as that faith itself does not propagate discriminatory and prejudicial attitudes
the woman refused a bank loan the disabled person refused access to a building the gay man refused accommodation a black person barred from a club and so on should all be protected on the basis of similar principles
but we must not condone the creation of ghettoes where only children of a specified faith are admitted to a school and others are excluded the commission text allows discriminatory access and i am not persuaded that amendment ! fifty one ] resolves the problem
it is important to be very firm about the preservation of freedom of speech which is usefully stressed through a specific mention which is added by the ` parliament ]
somebody of a different sexual orientation should be allowed to use any hotel room that they want to and stay at any hotel when they go on holiday
we were founded on human rights and anti discrimination
people of a different religion should not be discriminated against
that is why in the own initiative report @ last year ] i asked for a single directive to cover all areas that were not yet covered
now eventually we have got to the situation where we are debating an anti discrimination directive a possibility at long last that we might push through anti discrimination legislation on all grounds not covered disability age religion or belief and sexual orientation
let us just hope that we get that large majority
everyone should be treated equally across the
i know you have been doing a lot of work on this yourself
% eu ] a wheelchair user or a guide dog user should have free access anywhere within the % european union ]
please vote for it
this is the bedrock of the % european union ]
i urge all of you who are thinking of voting against this please do not
i have campaigned on disability and age @ for many years ] but i was convinced quite some time ago that we could not leave anybody behind we could not just go forward with a disability directive and then an age directive because i thought sexual orientation and religion would be left behind
all older people should have the right to have access to health care whatever their age
so i urge you even now to vote in favour and allow the ` council of ministers ] to do the right thing to make sure that it is absolutely proportionate and subsidiarity is respected
a determination that there would be no hierarchy of oppression
and to their voters as to why you believe some people should be treated differently from others that they should not have equality
i stand here fortunate as a gay man and if i chose to be gay is it not interesting that one obviously therefore chooses to be heterosexual
fighting for equality not just for gay men and lesbians and bisexuals and transgender people but for people on the basis of their age their religion their belief their gender anything that is perceived to be different that could be used to take equality away from them
i believe the litmus test of any civilised society is not how we treat a majority which interestingly is made up of so many different minorities
the litmus test of any civilised society as people listening in the visitors gallery will tell you is not how we treat the majority but how we treat the minorities and in that instance some member states are sadly lacking
} shakespeare ] said rather brilliantly the evil that men do lives on the good is oft interred with their bones look to yourself imagine if it were you who was different who had a different religion a different belief a different age a different sexual orientation would it be right
that you should have your human rights taken away from you
the answer has to be no
now is the opportunity for the house to do that which is right and just and good
mr president the chair of our committee mr } deprez ] spoke for so many of us in this house when he said that this was not a report about sectional interests or a report of the left but a report by mrs } buitenweg ] which was full of thoughtfulness sensitivity and compromise where people were concerned
the rapporteur has created a report which does not bind business or over regulate business as we have seen in the long journey of the ! two ] previous directives the & race equality directive ] and the & employment directive ] which i would say to mr } weber ] has not bound or over regulated businesses in % germany ] or in my country
in the % united kingdom ] we have the ` equality and human rights commission ] who recently supported the case of a ) european ] citizen } sharon coleman ] the mother of a disabled child who brought a case against her employer for disability discrimination by association something fundamental to mrs } buitenweg ] 's report
the ` european court of justice ] ruled in her favour and as a result of this judgement we have extended rights to % britain ] 's carers people who care for disabled people
i would say to people in this house that you will grow old you may be disabled and you may care for somebody with a disability
that is the reality for ! tens of millions ] of ) european ] citizens
it is not about sectional interests or concerns about who is going to dominate ! one ] other section of society
i would say that this report is not ) left ] or ) right ] it is about fundamental rights
as mr } cashman ] said in his speech people out there before the ) european ] elections will look to see whether we protected fundamental rights without doing anything bad to our businesses and our economy
mr president i will be voting against this report and this proposed directive for ! three ] reasons
~ first ] of all i dissent from the belief that the % eu ] rather than national governments should be legislating on these issues believing every member state is best placed to decide if it needs to strengthen such legislation
if ever there was a subsidiarity issue this should be it
my ~ second ] reason is that the new offence of harassment has the alarming prospect of in fact curbing the rights in respect of freedom of speech and freedom of religion particularly for those who proclaim a ) christian ] message
) christians ] preaching the gospel particularly in a public place to people of other faiths who take offence and who claim it is an assault on their dignity could be breaching this law
the ~ third ] reason is that the measures within the directive are disproportionate and inadequately balanced
it compels the ) christian ] printer for example to accept an order to print material which offends his religious beliefs whereas he should be free to conduct his business according to his conscience
without essential balancing mechanisms this directive will become an instrument which in fact creates discrimination
i strongly believe that no person should ever be discriminated against on the basis of his or her religion or belief disability or age
this help can come from us in different shapes and forms
the court made clear that data about ) european ] travellers cannot in general be retained @ for years ] by ) canadian ] authorities
but now with the entry exit system we would actually retain @ for years ] the personal data of ) canadians ] coming to * europe ] i e we would be doing exactly the same to our counterparts and i really do not see how we could explain that to our ) canadian ] partners
therefore we have requested an independent legal analysis of the implications of the court decision which we will publish @ tomorrow ]
that study says clearly that the entry exit system poses serious problems because the data retention periods are far too long and not justifiable and because rules on access by law enforcement agencies are not specific enough and i think that we as ` parliament ] should not adopt % eu ] legislation that will likely be struck down again by the court
of course we know that this debate is crucial for us but we do not agree to change the order
we should be careful because the negotiation on these amendments might delay the adoption of the decision and we might consider not engaging in lengthy and complicated negotiations in the framework of this decision
` parliament ] suggests also an increase in the ceilings of the % eu ] guarantees to be used by the bank
this should contribute to the efforts of the % european union ] partner countries to finance efforts to implement climate related policies
we ask the ` european investment bank ] to develop a stronger capacity for assessing and reporting on development environment and the human rights aspects of their projects
therefore the % eu ] has to make an additional effort to support the economies of the countries of the * western balkans ] and * north africa ] especially in these times
with this decision we shall start elaborating the common % eu ] position with the ` council ]
any increase in the ceilings means effectively a ! nine ] contribution to the guarantee fund but on the other hand this is an extremely good instrument creating leverage and attracting more funding institutions to the ` eib ] projects
the monitoring and reporting systems guarantee more transparency better access to information and increased possibilities for the stakeholders to give their opinion at an early stage of the consideration of the projects
at ~ first ] glance this is a very difficult decision because it is extremely sensitive for the member states
this would not involve substantial costs whereas the benefits of achieving the % eu ] 's objectives in these regions would be very high
during that period we discussed many ideas and tried to listen to the opinions of many stakeholders we held ! dozens ] of meetings both outside and within ` parliament ] between the political groups working on the text
now we have a draft decision to be voted by ` parliament ] which provides for more coordination between the ` european investment bank ] and the other % eu ] bodies for more transparency and stakeholder participation and for a better monitoring and reporting system a decision that will improve the visibility of the impact of the bank 's activities
the draft decision preserves the very successful profile of the ` european investment bank ] as a top rated financial institution and investment bank at the same time being an % eu ] institution the ` european investment bank ] is expected to contribute better to the goals of the % union ] through its specific means and tools
mr president the ` european investment bank ] uses public funds from the nations of * europe ] to guarantee loans either to financial intermediaries or to the ultimate recipients in ! seventy four ] countries
in particular in the case of ` eib ] lending which is meant to go to smes via intermediary banks the public still does not know where the money is going
when compared to other international institutions performing similar functions the ` eib ] 's reputation is not one of transparency and the public disclosure policy still does not cover appraisal reports
mr president up to now the professionals who run the ` european investment bank ] have operated the bank with a culture of financial probity
however what this report aims to do is to dilute the professional culture of the ` european investment bank ] and expand its remit to encompass a series of policy objectives
the commissioner made this very clear
a relaxation of the commercial criteria on which the bank has operated up to now will inevitably result in the guarantee being called on
now this will cost the taxpayer and i have to question once again whether the hard pressed taxpayers of * europe ] and the % uk ] really want their money to be used to advance purely political objectives outside the % eu ]
mr president when guaranteeing loans of this kind for projects inside or indeed outside the % eu ] we need to remember that they are not without financial consequences
while it may seem like a good way of making % eu ] money go further we must be very careful to ensure that the appropriate risk management controls are in place to manage these kinds of loans and the balance sheet implications they pose
as parliamentarians we need to be fully aware of the liabilities to which we are exposing the % eu ] budget and therefore member states budgets
oversight systems and transparency will be crucial when using the balance sheet for leverage as has been shown by the financial crisis where banks were not always fully aware of the extent of their liabilities
we must learn the lessons from the finance industry and be sure that we know precisely what the % eu ] is guaranteeing and what appropriate levels of democratic oversight are being maintained
fundamentally we must be sure that those individuals at the ` eib ] and the commission who are tasked with managing these financial products and making such wide ranging decisions have the appropriate expertise to manage what they are dealing with
we need to spend it carefully
it is a very stable financial institution and all the amendments that we tabled were targeted at keeping its stability on the market
we are committed to working on measures to boost cyber security in the financial sector and in particular we support facilitating the exchange of sensitive information between banks to prevent cyber attacks while of course protecting the use of personal data
we are committed to working with the ` parliament ] and ` council ] to take this forward
it provides an excellent overview of how much has been achieved since the financial crisis and clearly identifies much of what remains to be done
it should now be possible to support a better use of bank capital and liquidity resources across the ` banking union ]
these are just some of the areas that struck me in your report
the backstop should be fiscally neutral over the medium term there is another set of issues which will not be part of the current negotiations on the banking package because global guidance is needed there
in the case of the prudential treatment of sovereign debt we would like to better reflect the risks involved and we also hope with the differentiated capital treatment to incentivise diversification of exposures across sovereigns
the current solution credit lines between national governments and the ` esm ] is not sufficient to overcome the banks sovereign vicious circle and do away with the bailouts
the recommendations of the report concern all the pillars of the ` banking union ] the supervision resolution and deposit insurance and it looks into a variety of issues
we also have legacy issues to deal with such as non performing loans
the report has become a helpful stocktaking exercise before handing over to the colleagues leading the legislative discussions
however there are also broader issues in this report which will not be dealt with in the current commission banking package
i am especially thinking of the fiscal backstop it needs to be done and actually there is agreement to establish it
i hope the messages will be taken into account and will feed into legislative debates
what i intended to do with this report was to give a critical overview of the challenges we are facing while not pre empting the outcome of the legislative discussions on & edis ] as well as on the new banking package that amends & crr ] & crd ] & brrd ] and the & single resolution mechanism ] regulation
this has to be balanced with the need to keep some kind of safe asset to retain a benchmark for price formation on our financial markets and not to procyclically penalise financially fragile governments to conclude let us not forget that with the % uk ] out of the % union ] all member states except % denmark ] are committed to joining the euro in the future so we should encourage those countries to see the benefits of joining the ` banking union ] and of benefiting through ` banking union ] membership from participation in the decision sharing mechanism between home and host countries that we have established for the resolution of banks
we need to balance the creation of a level playing field between small and large banks and the transparency and comparability of capital requirements with the need for risk sensitivity and the possibility to use specific information from banks that can bring useful refinement to the model
is ` mps ] actually solvent
and we need finally to step up and address the too big to fail problem by introducing bank structural reform that actually separates commercial and investment banking
otherwise we are set to repeat history and it will be the ordinary decent families of * europe ] who will again pay the price
@ in recent months ] we have seen and heard the ~ first ] real test of the new rules on bank recovery and resolution in the ) italian ] banking crisis
we need to address the bad loan problem by ending the savage austerity agenda championed by this commission
if not it does not qualify for public assistance
to the importance of having a robust and stable financial system while at the same time ensuring that banks are able to play their role in lending to the wider economy to support growth and jobs
it is also committed to fostering self regulatory solutions by looking at the possibility of setting up an % eu ] trust mark for e commerce to complement a code of online rights
we can do this by harmonising rules for example on consumer contracts and we can streamline procedures to make them less costly for businesses conducting cross border transactions for example concerning waste management fees copyright levies vat reporting obligations and invoicing
we will explore how best to improve adr in the % eu ] and come forward with a proposal for an % eu ] wide online dispute resolution system for e commerce transactions by
alternative dispute resolution as mentioned in the report can provide low cost simple and quick redress for consumers shopping on the internet
as part of the ` consumer protection committee ] national authorities regularly cooperate to stamp out unlawful practices on the internet
many of the points raised are addressed in various policy domains including the digital agenda
@ earlier this month ] we launched an in depth study of e commerce
we can also make it easier for citizens and companies to interact with national administrations by setting up ! one ] stop shops
we will make consumers lives easier by enforcing % eu ] legislation in particular in relation to the & services directive ] which prohibits geographical discrimination against consumers
addressing the obstacles that citizens face in the online world can go a long way towards turning the promise of an integrated internal market into a reality
so what can we do to fill the gaps in the internal market and make e commerce work better the commission will reflect carefully on its response to the report
the commission also monitors the e commerce market through its yearly consumer markets scoreboard
at @ the beginning of two thousand and eleven ] a communication will be dedicated to the evaluation of the application of the e commerce directive and will reflect on its better enforcement
@ two thousand and twelve ] we also intend to ensure that consumers in mass claim situations across the % eu ] are able to obtain compensation proposals for adr and collective redress are also planned for the end of @ two thousand and eleven ] knowing that public authorities are working together to keep a close watch on the internal market is a foundation for creating confidence
most consumers have ~ first ] hand experience of the internal market when shopping online
the commission has set up a dedicated group of commissioners for the digital agenda to ensure a joined up approach to policy making on digital issues
~ first ] we need to make life easier and simpler for both consumers and businesses
in addition the ` council ] will be concerned with the review of the & late payment directive ] which is now being prepared and which is to ensure that small and medium sized enterprises are paid in time for all business transactions
especially the smes
~ secondly ] conclusions from the commission communication entitled towards world class clusters in the % european union ] implementing the broad based innovation strategy
we will ensure that these are the ! three ] priorities energy external relations and the economy which are fully integrated and interconnected and focus on the concrete initiative this is ! one ] of them
that will take place in % prague ] in @ early may ]
therefore the ) czech ] presidency will ensure that work continues intensively over the @ coming months ]
although the presidency is well aware of the obstacles that exist on the way toward successful completion of the whole process it will undoubtedly seek to give an effect to these commitments by working on the renewal of discussions on the & dda ] as soon as the conditions allow
therefore despite the fact that no conclusion was possible by the @ end of two thousand and eight ] the ` council ] remains fully committed to the multilateral trade system as well as to the conclusion of an ambitious balanced and comprehensive outcome of the ` wto ] # doha round ]
in particular for developing countries due to the development oriented character of this round
this is even more important given the current economic and financial situation
moreover in the light of the current political and economic development the ` european council ] in @ mid december last year ] stated in its conclusions that it endorsed the objective of arriving @ this year ] within the ` wto ] at an agreement on the modalities leading to the conclusion of the % doha ]
so we are all hoping for that
but now i have to respond to this question
i can assure you that the ratification process of the framework convention in the % czech republic ] is in progress
we all agree they need all the help they can get nicotine replacement therapies etc
but we must recognise the damage that passive smoking does to those who do not enjoy smoking so please do not feel personally under the spotlight here
could you guarantee me then that before the end of the ) czech ] presidency you will have ratified the framework convention yes or no it would be extremely important if you could give me guarantees on that
i am now fighting in my country for the earliest possible ratification of the & lisbon treaty ]
! one ] is housing and energy efficiency the ~ second ] ! one ] is nuclear energy but i know this is a sensitive issue for some member states
i would like to ask the minister if his attention has been drawn to the protectionist elements in the plan for recovery in the % united states ] particularly as put forward by members of the ` house of representatives ] and the ` senate ] and if he has on behalf of the ` council ] communicated the concern of the % european union ] to the } american ] administration about this
the commission welcomes the agreement reached between the ! two ] colegislators on our proposal concerning the recast of the regulation on characteristics for fishing vessels
for that reason the concerns especially of our coastal communities and their mainly small vessels fishing within quota have to be taken into consideration and
i invite you and ` parliament ] to resist these attempts because they would weaken the compromise that you have been able to reach
instead of referring matters to the individual infrastructure managers which cover only national sections of each corridor
! fifteen ] priority rules for trains are not something the commission will ever want to decide from % brussels ] freight traffic is systemically discriminated against today because passenger traffic always has priority even in cases of disturbance
some have gone as far as saying that with this regulation the commission wants to give priority to freight trains over passenger trains thus threatening the efficient provision of rail passenger services in particular at regional and local level
the infrastructure managers have the responsibility to predefine capacity
so it is not a supranational body but it is a tool which speeds up and simplifies in a very transparent and non discriminatory manner the path allocation process
the commission considers that the compromise obtained during the negotiation is balanced and that the general objectives of the commission 's proposals are duly taken into account
let me emphasise that the ! one ] stop shop is a joint body set up or designated by the management board of each corridor its function is that of a coordination tool
these corridors link the main industrial regions of * europe ] where the most substantive flow of goods originates and terminates along the main international axes
these include cooperation between rail infrastructure managers reliability of infrastructure capacities allocated to the corridors good coordination between rail infrastructure management and goods terminal management and non discriminatory access to these corridors for all operators
good quality rail infrastructure across borders is an essential condition for the competitiveness of many rail freight market segments and it is primordial if rail wants to compete with other modes of transport
notwithstanding the adverse economic cycle we are in there are some clear lessons to be learned how to revitalise the rail freight sector because rail freight transport is primarily international and an indisputable factor in its success is the availability of good quality rail infrastructure at the ) european ] level
this also explains why the commission proposed at @ the end of two thousand and eight ] the development of a ) european ] rail network for competitive freight based on freight corridors
the ` council ] 's position at ~ first ] reading maintains the basic principle put forward in the commission 's original proposal but waters down some of the elements
the legislative proposal to which your attention is drawn @ today ] contains decisive elements which favour this development of high quality rail infrastructure at international level
now we are at the end of the ~ second ] reading and the commission would like to reaffirm once again and in the strongest possible terms the political and industrial importance of the subject on which ` parliament ] has to decide
the ` tran committee ] has reintroduced at ~ second ] reading important amendments which strengthen the regulation and they bring back the original commission proposal
but of course the ! one ] stop shop is limited to catalogue or reserve capacity that is the capacity which the infrastructure managers themselves have already decided to set aside for freight trains corridor managers have also several options as to the way in which the ! one ] stop shop should be established
the ! one ] stop shop just sells paths to applicants on the basis of decisions already taken by infrastructure managers on the predefined infrastructure capacity
it may be a technical body within the corridor management structure or ! one ] of the infrastructure managers concerned or the bodies already established by ` rail net europe ]
what the text says is that the infrastructure managers themselves must take the responsibility to define transparent consistent non discriminatory rules for both types of traffic so that freight trains which are on time do not have to be systematically delayed in case of disturbance
now let me be very frank this is improper it is not the right reading of the proposal and it does not correspond at all to the texts that everybody can read in & article fourteen ] in article
we are very grateful to ` parliament ] in that it has succeeded in reinforcing the role of the one stop shop which had been reduced to a mere mail box in the common position of the ` council ] i know rapporteur that some people want to go back to the common position
for the railway undertakings and for other applicants which wish to have access to the corridor infrastructure the ! one ] stop shop is a considerable simplification of the present very burdensome procedure because the ! one ] stop shop will be able to take decisions itself
i think the point made by mr } marinescu ] is important
we see active participation of all the rail actors
in the light of this debate let me insist once again on ! two ] issues
the ~ first ] the ! one ] stop shop is not a supranational body but an operational tool to make the path allocation process more efficient
~ second ] this regulation can be implemented in full respect of the need for capacity of other types of transport in particular passenger transport
the commission thinks it will be very good for * europe ] if this proposal could be voted strongly @ tomorrow ]
the failure of our airlines and our airports to deal with a few centimetres of snow in a few member states caused devastating delay disruption and despair for travellers
unusual snowfalls and uncommonly low temperatures as predicted in @ two thousand and nine ] by the ` potsdam institute ] arise from the melting of the * arctic ice cap ]
i call on ` parliament ] 's ` committee on transport and tourism ] the union 's transport commissioner and transport ministers in the ` council ] to conduct an inquiry into the disruption to make provisions to prevent its recurrence to ensure that those affected are properly compensated and to study a sharing of the burden of compensation in future between the airline companies and others involved such as airport operators
mr president i rise to make a statement about the plight of ! hundreds of thousands ] of airline passengers in * europe ] in the @ ten days before christmas ] and the chaos in the arrangements for transporting them and their baggage to their intended destinations
this failure means that companies have to produce multiple product formulations to comply with different national laws
this is unfair and expensive especially as a scientific model for setting maximum amounts is available
the commission has yet to produce a proposal to harmonise the maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals that can be included in food supplements as required by the directive
mr president with regard to & article eighteen of the universal declaration of human rights ] and to & article ten of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union ] i was informed that on @ christmas day ] a massive abuse of religious freedom took place in the $ church of st ]
! three hundred ] now you understand why
mr president @ next week ] all across the world people will be celebrating the life of % scotland ] 's national poet } robert burns ]
what action can the commission and the ` council ] take in their transatlantic dialogues to put ) scottish ] haggis back not just on the agenda but also on the menu when it comes to ) american ] traditional ) scottish ] } burns ] suppers
the % eu ] is ready to engage with the government of % sudan ] on these issues
on @ twenty three october ] the ) sudanese ] court sentenced } zine al abidine ] to a @ three year ] suspended sentence and the editor in chief } osman mirgani ] to @ six months ] in jail for criminal conspiracy and disruption of the public order
} mirgani ] was released the following day after a fine for his release was paid
this includes the strengthening of the democratisation process respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the adoption of genuine political and economic reforms addressing the root causes of conflict
the % union ] is for example supporting several projects on press freedom as well as civic and human rights education in % sudan ] through the european instrument for democracy and human rights
as a consequence the newspaper was immediately suspended for @ two years ]
such concerns were highlighted in a statement issued by the % european union ] with like minded partners in @ december ]
civil society organisations are largely inhibited from operating at full capacity with crackdowns on protesters human rights defenders journalists members of the opposition and religious minorities
the union will continue to call on the government to respect freedom of expression and enable space for civil society
we need to ensure that not a euro is diverted to fund surveillance and it systems that could assist in repression of journalists and media
the ) sudanese ] intelligence agency has been waging an actual war on freedom of information and expression @ for years ]
i think that the high representative the commission and member states need to step up support to civil society that can help and reform press and printing legislation
there is no hope for democracy if these basic values continue to be threatened my main concern is that the % eu ] gives ( eur one hundred million ] in aid to % sudan ] on migration
these journalists are not alone in facing repression
} al abidine ] in a clear case of political persecution and selective justice has been sentenced to a suspended sentence of @ five years ] ostensibly for writing a piece alleging corruption associated with the ruling family of president } omar al bashir ]
in @ two thousand and sixteen ] there were ! forty four ] occurrences of confiscated publications affecting ! twelve ] different newspapers which gives you an idea of the widespread nature of such repressive practices in % sudan ]
mr president again we observe the heinous measures which dictatorships are willing to use in order to silence even the slightest criticism legitimate criticism
by this time we ought to know to what lengths authoritarian regimes are ready to go in order to silence any perceived threats
as a former journalist i realise the indispensable role of a free press in any state grounded in the rule of law
the % european union ] must condemn the unjust sentencing of } mohamed zine al abidine ] and } osman mirgani ] and increase the pressure on the ) sudanese ] regime
the president and his companions must cease their actions
the people of % sudan ] too deserve to live in freedom in security and democracy
} al abidine ] did what a journalist is supposed to do shed light on those in power but is now being sentenced to @ five years ] as ! one ] of many critics that are silenced
we call on the ) sudanese ] authorities to review these outrageous charges and to respect all people 's rights
the government should at least adhere to its own commitments under the & cotonou agreement ] but also to the & declaration on media freedom in the arab world ]
we in the % eu ] should step up our efforts to make sure that people 's rights are respected in % sudan ] including the freedom of expression online and offline
i would suggest that by only focusing on managing migration we are not doing that we are not prioritising respect for human rights
in fact we may well give people a good excuse to repress and to keep people down
i think that is the wrong development also from our side
mr president in a country where widespread violations of human rights have been extensively reported by international organisations such as ` waging peace ] the case of } mohamed zine al abidine ] is extremely worrying
his arrest and imprisonment follows repeated acts of intimidation and harassment conducted by the authorities against journalists
it is clear that the ) sudanese ] government seeks to silence critical voices by means of judicial harassment censorship and confiscation of newspapers
these unacceptable actions have been taking place in the context of total disregard by mr } omar albashir ] a total disregard for human rights and international law
he still has not been brought to justice regarding the grave accusations of genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity that were filed against him @ several years ago ]
high representative } federica mogherini ] must also put all her efforts into presenting mr } albashir ] to the ` international criminal court ]
stay border controls have to be installed on all the external borders of the % european union ] and refugees should be registered
so when the ` council ] meets @ next week ] i hope we will see less finger pointing and more of a willingness to act together in the long term interests of all ) european ] countries and especially those who are truly eligible for refugee status
countries that disagree or cannot accept a quota system should be asked what other contributions they could make to help lessen the pressure
mr president the % eu ] is made up of ! twenty eight ] countries not just ! one ] or ! two ] % eu ] actions and decisions should therefore be taken in a spirit of consultation not unilaterally declared by ! one ] or ! two ] leaders who then expect everyone else to follow
as ~ first ] vice president } timmermans ] just said no finger pointing but the reprimands and the ad hoc and rash decision making that we are seeing are causing us to lose focus on strengthening our cooperation and vital actions to tackle the roots of the crisis
it is simply not fair
much of the commission 's proposal is correct improving reception centres speeding up processing and returns tackling human trafficking and looking at how * europe ] can be a force for good in assisting those countries where ! ninety seven ] of the refugees are located
by imposing emergency relocation schemes on countries that are for many reasons opposed we are storing up trouble for any future proposals which offer the best long term solutions
but i believe that resettling the most vulnerable refugees straight from the camps in their home regions is the most responsible thing all the member states can do
those member states who believe there is more than ! one ] solution are currently accused of being less ) european ] than others
by forcing member states to take migrants bear the costs involved and fundamentally dig % germany ] out of a self created financial social humanitarian and political debacle not content with inflicting the migrant chaos on its own in some cases beleaguered citizens
% germany ] is using bully boy tactics to force this crisis on to its neighbours
it is threatening financial penalties on countries that will not cooperate and it has seemingly endorsed a ( eur seven hundred and eighty million ] budget
` frontex ] is not a common border agency it is our people that we take from a number of member states for member states % italy ] % greece ] and so on and they are doing the job while it should be a mandatory system in which all ! twenty eight ] member states participate
and the only way to come out of this debate is not only to talk about this shared responsibility that is one of the elements and we are going to vote on this with ` parliament ] but it is to have a broad approach
to finish i will not hide from you that i felt disappointed and frustrated on > monday evening ] even though progress was
refuge it is time for each and every one to take their responsibilities
this action is needed now and the ` council ] @ next week ] is the opportunity to make an important step forward all together
there was a willingness of the majority of member states but not all to move forward towards an agreement on relocating another ! one hundred and twenty ] ! zero ] persons
all the only pragmatic and humanitarian response is an ambitious ) european ] one and a comprehensive
i can assure you that we will work closely and with all member states to have swift results
as you know there will be another extraordinary ` council ] meeting already @ next week ] we cannot fail on this it will be a crucial meeting and the commission is ready to provide full support to enable decisions on the files the objective of the commission is to preserve the unity of * europe ]
let me start from where we stand
i would like to underline that the ` european parliament ] is participating fully in this process for the framework for the crisis and location mechanism as well as for the list of safe countries of origin
this house warmly supported this package in its resolution @ last week ]
the commission proposals in this respect were welcome and will be further discussed
the ~ second ] implementing package that we presented to you @ last week ] serves this goal to respond to the emergency situation in our borders by enhancing both the responsibility and the solidarity aspects
made it was not enough it is nothing compared to the magnitude of the crisis
we also need to be pragmatic and accept that we have to respond together united to this crisis
these people will not be stopped by any cold sea any fence any
we are in contact with all member states and we are ready to work with them over @ the coming days ] so that all member states will go the extra mile to find a ) european ] solution
this is something that we all politicians need to address
hot spots will be bases to make this approach a success the ~ first ] relocation will start immediately but for our proposal to relocate ! one hundred and twenty ] ! zero ] additional persons from % italy ] % greece ] and % hungary ] we do not have the agreement we wanted
in the ` council ] on @ monday ] we made some progress as well
one there is no single solution to this crisis we need to address all issues to fight the root causes to support and cooperate with the neighbouring countries to better protect our borders to fight smugglers with all the means we have to increase the reception capacities in the countries most affected and to ensure solidarity when it comes to finding for them a safe
we need unity @ today ] in the % european union ]
there are people out there suffering in ! hundreds of thousands ] on our continent
the % eu ] does not at this point need unanimity
what a contrast to see this
those like } angelika niebler ] who just now said that we should please act together should understand that this is now about the % european union ] and the ability for us to follow the commissioner and his plans and the presidency which is well organised at > three o 'clock ] even ` parliament ] realised that it must vote @ tomorrow ] because the member states in the minority were not acting everything is there for us to do but we have not done it because of those member states we were not born yesterday we know who is blocking this let us unblock it do something and stop the shame of * europe ] and those who think they know better
they do not know better
everyone from all parts of the political spectrum in this chamber should see what these images are saying about the % european union ]
we have spent more than ! one ]
please colleagues i have got to ask for order in the
i am being as fair as i possibly can to everybody
we are debating a very sensitive subject clearly there are huge divisions in this house
you have used an expression in your speech ms } le pen ] has responded
} keller ]
debate we are going to have these interruptions
the failure of the ` council ] meeting on migration to provide safe and legal access for refugees fleeing the harrowing impacts of conflicts is absolutely shameful we need to ensure that all countries do their fair share in resolving this crisis
% ireland ] as a nation can accept thousands of refugees we must ensure that these people become part of the fabric of our society and are not discarded in direct provision sites we must activate the & temporary protection directive ] enhance the & syria vulnerable persons relocation scheme ] and suspend the & dublin regulation ] which forces refugees and asylum seekers to register in the country they land
in the ) european ] focus on keeping them out rather than keeping them safe has resulted in in the drowning of ! thousands ] of people in the * mediterranean ]
mr president those of you who know ? game of thrones ] will know the expression winter is coming
it is meant quite literally and it is meant metaphorically
this expression can be applied to the situation the % european union ] is in now vis vis the refugees
but winter might also be coming metaphorically for the % european union ] if we are incapable of action in the @ next couple of days ] and weeks
applause this issue left unresolved will undoubtedly lead to human suffering for the refugees to political turmoil in our member states to strife between member states and to tensions which * europe ] cannot afford to have
so we have a strong strong responsibility ` parliament ] ` council ] and commission to make sure that what we did not achieve @ last monday ] in the ` council ] will be achieved without delay
yes it is difficult to have far reaching results @ within five days ] of the commission making proposals but we have no time to lose
i want to salute this ` parliament ] and its president for your courageous steps forward in line with the commission proposals
and so does the commission
i want to add ! one ] more point which to me is very important
the commission is willing to build bridges between the different positions of member states
we cannot afford the luxury of accusing one another of not wanting to reach a solution
we have to have the skill the openness and the willingness to build bridges to help countries come to a common solution which will express solidarity and responsibility
my plea is also to all of you to please explain to your constituents and to your people back home that our proposals are not just about a distribution key to express solidarity with those states who are really suffering @ today ]
this is unacceptable if we want to uphold the * europe ] of freedom solidarity and human rights the ` council ] needs to act now because what is at stake is our own credibility
i want to tell you that the temporary reintroduction of border controls is explicitly foreseen in the legislation for exceptional situations and as a temporary
means is not compatible with ) european ] values and principles
we are here to preserve and guarantee freedom of movement in * europe ] but we also need to secure our external ) european ]
yes i expressed my frustration at the outcome of the recent ` council ] but with your support and the excellent work done by the % luxembourg ] presidency we will all go this extra mile
however the ) socialist ] family is deeply concerned about the political climate in that country
this time it is not only about political dialogue or its absence
the problem is not just about the current very sharp and dangerous crisis the problem is that we have seen this before in @ december ]
it is a matter of upholding basic democratic standards which are extremely important for the negotiations
> tonight ] the opposition party is publishing further evidence this time alleging electoral malpractice on behalf of the governing party while the governing party has a simultaneous press conference alleging bribery on behalf of the leader of the opposition
but let me make some things very clear the announcement of charges and the threat of imprisonment against the leader of the opposition in the country the leader of the sister party of the group of parties which i represent in this chamber is a dangerous moment for democracy in this country
we cannot ignore that evidence and nor can the commissioner
these practices have no place @ today ] in this country or in * europe ]
in saying that i am conscious that success would require genuine political will on both sides and that the longterm interests require functioning political institutions within the country rather than reliance on external assistance
we in this chamber do not want to be drawn into a spiral of allegations and counterallegations nor into the conflicting explanations about the provenance of the tapes but there is no doubt that mass surveillance has taken place and that at least some of the evidence produced is genuine
for the charges to be announced by the prime minister personally only adds to the concerns generated following the evidence of tapes released in relation to apparent gross political interference in the country 's judiciary and media
these are very serious charges that need independent and proper investigation and the high representative of the % union ] and the ` council ] has been clear on this the ` council ] will revert to the issue any time @ this year ] on the basis of an update by the commission on implementation of reforms
i can say that the ` council ] is fully aware of recommendations by the commission and we adopted conclusions in that context in @ december ]
@ two thousand and fourteen ] yet with respect to the current political situation the % eu ] has expressed serious concerns
including in the context of the highlevel accession dialogue and on tangible steps taken to promote good neighbourly relations and to reach a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution for the name issue
on the other hand this is a part of the world which has a long tradition of animosity springing out of a shared but contested history
i do not accept responsibility here for what is happening @ today ] in this country but we should accept that we have contributed to the conditions where this political crisis has been generated and i ask the current presidency to do better than its predecessors in actually making good the words that she has shared with us } tonight ]
there are now ! fifteen ] member states in the ` council of ministers ] who want to move forward on this country
i believe that the most efficient way to do this is to stimulate the integration and reform agenda
it is unfortunate that political stalemate has evolved into sharp confrontation between the opposition and the ruling party
in this respect we should be ready to help the country to get back on track
as regards the current political events in the country i visited % skopje ] in @ february ] and expressed my very serious concerns to all political leaders all of them must step back from the brink
they have no time to lose
they remain fundamental for the very functioning of the country and its % eu ] perspective
in my frequent and ongoing contacts with the political leadership and the opposition i continue to urge political actors to engage in constructive dialogue within the ` parliament ] focusing on the strategic priorities of the country and all its citizens
the commission will work closely with the meps in this respect
i will come to this in > a second ]
i would like to reiterate that the commission stands ready to provide support while fully insisting on the separation of powers the commission could support efforts to improve checks and balances and address failures for instance through the assessment on continued concerns about the independence of justice
to build on the positive lessons learned so far the review of the & ohrid framework agreement ] is important and should be soon converted into policy recommendations finally let me stress that renewed efforts from all sides are needed to improve relations and trust between parties and these need to
it is of the utmost importance that there are continued efforts to improve the overall climate for cooperation and trust
good neighbourly relations remain an essential part of the enlargement process and the % eu ] 's own history shows that working out compromises on contested issues is the best way to enhance regional cooperation and move forward i would also like to use this opportunity to highlight the importance of maintaining good interethnic relations
turning to the issue of good neighbourly relations i agree with you that it is an essential part of the country 's progress towards the % european union ]
i share your concerns that delays in setting a date for the start of accession negotiations have added to the frustration of the population in the country and also affected the sustainability of previous reforms as well as the leverage of the % union ] as such
this includes a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to the name issue under the auspices of the ` united nations ] we call for progress towards bringing the longstanding discussions on this issue to a definitive conclusion without delay in the light of the overall importance of maintaining good neighbourly relations it is essential to continue highlevel contacts between the % former yugoslav republic of macedonia ] and % bulgaria ] and to translate them into concrete
however i would point out that the ` council ] conclusions of @ december two thousand and fourteen ] emphasised serious concerns about an increasing politicisation of state institutions and growing shortcomings in relation to the independence of the judiciary and to media freedoms
this will take into account the highlevel accession dialogue and the tangible steps taken to promote good neighbourly relations and to reach a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to the name issue
failure to deliver on these issues has damaged the sustainability of reforms
action and results finally let me add that the ` council ] broadly shares the commission 's assessment that the political criteria continue to be sufficiently met on the basis of the cumulative progress achieved
concerning the interethnic situation greater trust between the communities needs to be built the & ohrid framework agreement ] continues to be an essential element for democracy and rule of law in the former ) yugoslav ] % republic of macedonia ]
as shown by the latest developments political crises between government and opposition parties are recurrent the ` council ] shares the view expressed in ` parliament ] 's draft resolution that a more constructive and inclusive political dialogue is needed
the ` council ] reiterates that maintaining good neighbourly relations remains an essential part of ) european ] integration
you shouldn 't be looking at ` farm europe ] on the website because they are giving you the wrong information i look forward to % france ] being very strong supporters of getting member states particularly % denmark ] the % netherlands ] % sweden ] and % austria ] in unanimity in order to do more so that we can reduce this particular impact on our farmers
strengthening the farmers position in the food chain is also important
in an effort to improve market transparency the commission has established a dedicated sheep and goatmeat dashboard which is published on its website
maintaining current production levels in sensitive sectors is ! one ] of the reasons why the & cap ] foresees the possibility for member states to provide voluntary coupled support for the sheep sector
supporting it is in the interest of all of
ms } herranz garca ] 's report is another valuable contribution to the discussion about this important sector
the ~ first ] countries that actually objected to this were the % united states ] % australia ] and % new zealand ] and these are supposed to be the best friends of the % united kingdom ] when it comes to a future trading relationship
the commission shares the rapporteur 's view in regard to the importance of small ruminants not only for producing a whole range of market goods like meat milk wool and skins but also in relation to landscape conservation the fight against countryside desertification and the preservation of our cultural heritage
i look forward to the leadership of % france ] in this regard mr president i want to thank the rapporteur ms } herranz garca ] for her report on the sheep and goat sector this report rightly highlights the very specific features that are associated with this type of farming in the % eu ] recognising the contribution of the sheep sector as well as its vulnerability i established a sheepmeat forum in the @ autumn of two thousand and fifteen ] to provide our stakeholders together with my services with the opportunity to discuss the challenges and opportunities that face the sector
this gives regular market updates and provides stakeholders with information about the main market developments inside and outside the % eu ]
i can assure you that the commission will continue supporting the sector 's efforts to become more market orientated and secure its long term sustainability
the report 's suggestion to increase this level of support has to be seen in the context of the proposals for the future cap
the ~ first ] one is around how we are going to allocate the tariffrate quotas that come from % new zealand ] and % australia ] to the % european union ] and maybe the commissioner would respond to that because that is a significant issue
as i understand it the plans such as they are by the % uk ] and the % european union ] on this issue are not acceptable to the countries involved
you might comment
the ~ second ] issue is also brexitrelated because many of the lambs produced in % northern ireland ] come to the % republic of ireland ] for processing and then go to % france ] for consumption
clearly we will have problems around that issue when # brexit ] happens and we 're not clear as to the shape of # brexit ] around customs around borders and around standards
they tell me an end to % eu ] grants to the ` iwf ] and the ` uk safer internet centre ] puts at risk the amount of child sexual abuse material they will be able to remove from the internet
% uk ] # safer internet day ] is the biggest # safer internet day ] in * europe ] reaching nearly ! three million ] children and their parents each year
we should not forget that it is % afghanistan ] that should have the ownership of its economic and political processes therefore we should particularly support local initiatives and support the infrastructures to improve its citizens participation in political life
if you want our development efforts in % afghanistan ] to be successful we ~ firstly ] need to contribute to security building and we need to take steps in preventing radicalisation fighting corruption and establishing a strong and independent civil society
in this regard i would suggest that the % eu ] makes more of an effort in raising the efficiency of military spending including optimisation of industrial sectors and so on
the ) european ] automotive industry must adapt much faster to mobility transition
i agree entirely with these priorities so i was proud to vote for the report in addition it was good that the amendment to the report seeking to promote incentives to use mega trucks was defeated as these are dangerous and unnecessary
however it was disappointing that the point in the report on phasing out new emitting cars by @ two thousand and thirty five ] was not approved
this excellent report calls strongly for a change towards more sustainable modes of transport a deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure and an ambitious action plan for the increasing use of electric vehicles
( trillions of pounds ] euros and dollars are being siphoned off through loopholes to avoid tax while our public services are starved of money and the world 's poorest are hit hardest this is a global problem but the % panama ] papers revealed % britain ] to be top of the leader board with the greatest number of offshore companies and trusts amongst % eu ] nations
i welcome the blacklist of tax havens and sanctions against them more transparency more cooperation as well as a globally recognised definition of a tax haven
it is high time we end having one set of rules for the super rich and another for the rest of us
mr president it is an extraordinary thing when we think of the blood and treasure that was poured into % afghanistan ] in an attempt to keep out other countries one way or another the huge damage done to that state because of rival powers attempting to gain influence there
the ! one ] thing that was never really properly tried and which still has not been tried is properly integrating % afghanistan ] into the world economy allowing the institutions of private property and free contract to flourish there
we are still i am afraid playing these great game power politics which end up treating the ethnic groups and the tribes of % afghanistan ] as pawns rather than as constructs made up of individuals each with their own interests in markets and success
i hope that the time for % afghanistan ] will come
we need to develop deeper and more active relations with % hong kong ] as it has the potential to become an example of democratisation and liberalisation for other states in the * east ] and * south east asia ] region
it was a while before the stories of the atrocities suffered by the ) rohingya ] people began to spread beyond newspapers that were either in ) muslim ] majority countries or ) muslim ] oriented in their readerships
but i think we have now got a sense of the magnitude of what is taking place
i wonder whether we were slow because it challenged our western perceptions
we simultaneously struggle to see people as victims and as doers of violence there is at the moment no worse human rights crisis on the planet and we cannot leave overwhelmed % bangladesh ] to try and deal with this issue bilaterally
if ever there was a case where we needed to step in this is it
we are currently implementing a lot of measures from the steel action plan
it has to be tackled both on the national and the ) european ] level
we need strong modernised and innovative ) european ] industry and this is the basis for all of our actions
i am responsible for this together with commissioner } vella ]
we should address at this conference with all of the stakeholders the very critical issues such as investment including the role which the investment plan will play in these sectors energy the circular economy package trade and last but not least research and development in order to secure the future of our industry
~ firstly ] i want to say very strongly that we need strong ) european ] industry we need a strong ) european ] steel industry
in this context the commission is also willing to consider opening investigations based on the threat of injury
trade defence action is triggered by applications from industry
table given that this is a legal process subject to scrutiny not only by the member states but also by the courts and in some instances the ` wto ] time is needed to ensure that any action taken is in line with the legislation and our international obligations
the report offers a very interesting perspective for the current debate on how to support the sector something that is really vital for our economy the report also highlights fundamental issues that have been at the centre of the commission 's report
as regards opening cases there is nothing to be gained from this time wise as it still requires the existence of sufficient evidence and this can only be furnished by the industry
the austerity policies are much more destructive than energy prices
mr president we want the ) european ] steel industry to have a sustainable future but it is obviously just not good enough for the commission to say it will try to come back with some solutions
without even mentioning the core fact that we have vast overcapacity in * europe ] in the steel sector
it would be counterproductive in fact the steel industry would be biting ! one ] of the few hands that can feed it if it were seduced by certain conservatives to go against climate policy because only investment in infrastructure and the transformation of our economies can provide new uses for steel
} edouard martin ] 's report offers long term solutions to this crisis and if implemented correctly it could put ) european ] steel on the path to a sustainable future
we in % britain ] like to think that we are different from the rest of * europe ]
today i am calling on the ) uk ] government to stop hiding behind their excuses for inaction to stop blocking the vital reform of % eu ] trade defence measures and to recognise that steel is a strategic foundation industry on which all of our manufacturing is based
other countries believe in industrial policy
it is clear that the global steel market is saturated with overcapacity especially from % china ] driving down prices to unsustainable levels
we have had enough high level meetings
the ) european ] steel sector is in crisis sites are closing with ! thousands ] of well paid highly skilled jobs lost
we have had enough summits
now we need to see action from the commission and from national governments
it should be supported when it comes to plenary
other countries have supported their industries within % eu ] state aid rules
we need to modernise and strengthen our trade defence tools to make them more effective acting quicker tackling social and environmental dumping and opening them up to give the workforce the ability to initiate complaints
but we have a secretary of state who refuses to say the words
but this is a difference which is killing our industries and communities like my own
i suspect it would be as successful as extending the ets to the airline sector proved to be
mr president the steel industry is important for our economy providing employment for ! thousands ] of our constituents
% eu ] climate policies are at fault here hurting competitiveness raising prices and ultimately driving industry out of * europe ]
i would ask the commissioner to explain what she is going to do to support the industry and combat the anti competitive practices it faces
this month 's meeting of % eu ] ministers called by the ) uk ] business secretary } sajid javid ] showed strong agreement on the need to take concrete action
many countries around the world have reacted to this threat including the % united states ] % india ] and % brazil ]
the steel sector now needs action not proposals that have no prospect of success
i do not believe the carbon border adjustment mechanism proposed by mr } martin ] in his report is the answer
@ since two thousand and seven ] despite rising demand for aluminium ! eleven ] of the ! twenty four ] smelters in the % eu ] have shut down
i fear it will invite retaliation and encourage protectionism around the world
~ secondly ] look at the electricity prices which will be up ! forty seven ] by @ two thousand and twenty ] and immediately rethink the persecution of our manufacturing in the name of green dreams
manufacturing matters
totally uncompetitive dumping from % china ]
~ first ] of all combat the dumping by % china ]
mr president it is clear from listening to > tonight ] 's debate that colleagues from all over * europe ] are concerned about the crisis in the steel industry and i would like to thank the ) uk ] government for calling the emergency meeting to see what more we can do to help
yes this is partly due to overcapacity in the global market but decisions we take now in this sector have long lasting consequences because moth balling is not viable
i am not asking you to bend or break competition rules but rather to make the decisions quickly please commissioner
we should apply a more systematic approach
we urgently need to have this debate but more than that we urgently need the commission to take rapid action to make sure that we are using all the anti dumping measures that the commission and the % eu ] have at their disposal
incredibly ! thousands ] of jobs have been lost
that action needs to be taken now and i am calling on the commission to do so in order that we can have a % uk ] steel industry that we can be proud of
we are proud of our % uk ] industry but we also need to make sure we can retain the skills that we have and also be able to compete in the marketplace
as i stressed in my remarks there the ` un human rights council ] has a responsibility to ensure that stated intentions are translated into real action and real progress
what matters in the end is not the number of resolutions that are passed but results in the real world that make a difference to people who are in need
already before the # high level segment ] the ` council ] had called for an inquiry and recommended the suspension of % libya ] 's membership of the ` council ] which as you know has since been confirmed by the ` general assembly ] in a unanimous decision
for obvious reasons on that occasion the situation in % libya ] was at the heart of our discussions
the rights to free speech freedom of assembly justice and equality are not ) european ] rights they are universal rights
this is a key objective of the ongoing review process
let me conclude by stressing once again the importance of the ` human rights council ] for the % eu ] the debates the resolutions and the rapporteurs
faced in @ recent months ] with an increasing number of acts of religious discrimination and violence in different parts of the world we need to send a strong collective message against religious intolerance and in favour of the freedom of religion or belief for all people everywhere
the % eu ] also is engaging with the ) tunisian ] authorities to jointly present a draft resolution on the subject of boosting ` un ] technical assistance on human rights in the context of ongoing transition
we believe that in both cases the severity and number of human rights violations justify the extension of the mandates of the respective ` un ] special rapporteurs
the % eu ] also supports the initiative to create a special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in % iran ] as proposed by several countries and regions
the % eu ] welcomes % egypt ] 's invitation to ms } pillay ] to send members of her office to the country
that is why we speak out and we act against human rights violations wherever they occur
the real test is whether we make a difference on the ground
we have several priorities for the ~ sixteenth ] session of the ` human rights council ] and we have discussed these actively with our partners
we must never fall into the trap of believing that people in other parts of the world whether it is * africa ] * asia ] or * latin america ] should be any less passionate about their rights
we also recognise that * europe ] 's own path on human rights protection has not been a straight line and that constant efforts are also needed inside * europe ] at the ` human rights council ] we are ready to discuss our own challenges share experiences and offer support to those working to improve respect for human rights around the world
a particular concern is the dramatically increasing number of death penalty cases more than ! one hundred ] so far @ this year ] as we discussed in our previous debate and the repression of those exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly we feel the ` council ] should address the situation in % egypt ] in an appropriate manner taking into account the rapidly evolving situation in that country
other key situations that need to be addressed by this session of the ` human rights council ] are % belarus ] where we are deeply concerned at the number of political prisoners the % democratic republic of congo ] where there are distressing reports of continuing human rights violations in particular widespread sexual violence as well as % cte d 'ivoire ]
we will also table resolutions on % burma ] % myanmar ] and the % democratic people 's republic of korea ]
we are seriously concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in % iran ]
for that reason the % eu ] will work hard to strengthen the ` human rights council ] and especially its ability to address urgent situations
but in the end these are only inputs
the % eu ] will present an initiative on freedom of religion or belief
all that is proof that multilateral institutions can live up to their mandate and can act in what we call real time
i am pleased that the international community sent a strong and united political signal regarding the ongoing human rights violations in % libya ]
i also emphasised that human rights are universal
i think that ms } pillay ] the ` un ] high commissioner for human rights whom i met in % geneva ] is giving exactly the right direction politically in order to make a difference on the ground
as honourable members may know i addressed the ` council ] @ last week ] together with many foreign ministers from across the world
how in the name of god could we vote down something like that
i want to know from the high representative if you are you going to raise this issue with the ` un ]
! six million ] ) jews ] were murdered in the # second world war ] here in * europe ]
this is not to do with abortion because a woman 's life is in danger or because she is in danger of having a back street abortion
mr president i welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate and can i say at the outset that i appreciate the briefing arranged by the high representative yesterday on the issues surrounding % libya ]
when is political correctness going to be overcome so that we can have respectful debates here so that we do not turn our heads the other way as happened in the @ first half of the last century ] so that we raise these issues so that we ask why this is
that is what this % european union ] is supposed to be about unity in diversity
i have not heard anybody from the ) socialist ] or ) liberal ] side raise in this house the issue of gender based abortion
it is a shameful occurrence on the record of this house for those people who did it
not only did they not raise it they voted down a resolution put to this house not to fund infanticide or coercive abortion
it is more than i received from her in relation to my view we have to have respectful debate in this house where people hear each other 's views and then we come to conclusions
i reflect on the fact that it is @ two years ] since the publication of ms } andrikien ] 's report on the development of the ` un human rights council ] including the role of the % eu ] and on the resolutions that have been passed since that report was produced
it is certainly not quite where we would have wished it to be but now that we have seen the transfer to % new york ] of some of the discussions we can continue to work there as well
life i think that is probably
my team has just been meeting with a group of meps to talk further about what more we should do on this
human there are no other criteria that should
us i hope that we will be able to move forward on that @ over the coming weeks and months ]
my general point is that we believe in the right of freedom of religion and belief whatever that religion or belief might be in that context
we do indeed hence i know about the weekly reports
however the honourable gentleman is completely right that the significant part of this is to make sure that people 's rights are not violated and that we ensure humanitarian support is given
very finally i have not made any decision about opening a delegation in
we need to build alliances on human rights and to have the opportunity to talk with partners across the world where we can make common cause on some of the most important issues that concern
to those honourable members who specifically talked about freedom of religion and belief let me first of all say that i do indeed talk about the terrible tragedies for ) christian ] communities anywhere in the world where these terrible tragedies occur
if i might just finish with this i was very taken by what mr } salavrakos ] said when he said that human rights is a way of
in my conversations on this i am also clear on the need to think better and more creatively about how we operate in % geneva ]
it is important that we continue to make those statements as clearly as possible when you see terrorism or attacks on any religions including ) christianity ]
right i describe it as being this simple for human rights to apply to you you simply have to be here and
i think we have all been pushing hard with the review to try to make that review as strong as possible
this really is an area of work where parliamentarians working with us can make a significant difference
we give ( eur one two billion ] to the rebuilding of % iraq ] and yet every time we pass a resolution in this house every time we pass a written declaration with a big majority we are simply ignored by the ) iraqi ] government and by their ) iranian ] cohorts they are psychologically torturing the people in $ camp ashraf ] with ! two hundred and ten ] loudspeakers blaring propaganda and threats at a high decibel level day and night @ for the last year ] they are prohibiting access to medicines and the hospital for injured people and people dying of cancer
i am disappointed that the outcome document for the working group on the review omits any independent trigger for special sessions that there is no requirement for member countries to justify failure to respond to recommendations and that there is no provision at all for addressing specific country situations
in conclusion i believe that % libya ] 's suspension from the ` human rights council ] creates a historic precedent for respect for human rights in the ` un ] system which in these dark days shines a light on the silver thread
~ firstly ] given what she said about the % democratic republic of the congo ] will ) europeans ] support the appointment of a special mandate holder for that country ~ secondly ] does she accept that at some stage a judgment has to be made as to whether the ) palestinian ] and ) israeli ] investigations in relation to the } goldstone ] report meet international standards with a deliberation on the possible referral to the international criminal court if they do not
to show in this debate that the high representative does answer questions can i ask her ! three ] in particular
~ thirdly ] will the % eu ] lodge an objection to % pakistan ] 's reservation on & article forty ] the obligation to report of the & international covenant of civil and political rights ]
our ` parliament ] will be present at a crucial time for the review of the ` human rights council ] as the global fulcrum for respect of human rights the universal periodic review of all ` un ] members the independence of its experts or so called special procedures and the enhanced role for civil society participation they are key characteristics of the ` council ] that we should work to protect at all costs
last but not least i would like to welcome the establishment of the ` directorate for human rights and democracy ] in the ` eeas ] system
it is important that the % eu ] member states and the ` european external action service ] actively engage in the @ two thousand and eleven ] review of the ` council ] to strengthen compliance with its mandate
the establishment of the ` external action service ] also provides us with a unique opportunity to streamline our action on the protection of human rights in the ` united nations human rights council ] i therefore want to encourage the high representative to make sure that ) european ] efforts in the ` human rights council ] are well coordinated and that % eu ] member states belonging to this body are united and effective as never before
it must also be willing to listen and able to compromise
but at least the independence of the human rights commissioner and of the special procedure was not damaged so this is already an achievement under the present conditions
they can show that different regional groups can come together and they can show that the ` council ] does not need to be divided
this time is significant for another reason a ~ first ] comprehensive review of the working methods of the ` council ] has come to a conclusion and like my colleagues i feel disappointed by the fact that the ` council ] failed to appreciate the importance of the review
it needs increased resources and its work must be integrated into all fields of % eu ] foreign policy
so to my last point the % eu ] 's performance after the creation of the ` human rights and democracy directorate ] at the ` european external action service ] the % eu ] delegation in % geneva ] will have a central role to play in % eu ] human rights policy in the world
@ today ] there is no longer a reason why action on % iran ] % north korea ] the % democratic republic of congo ] % burma ] and % sudan ] could not be next in line
the % eu ] prepared itself well but failed to win the support of others
in any future discussions of the ` council ] 's work the % european union ] must be able to build alliances and to reach across to other partners
i think we had a very welcome participation by the high representative in the meeting @ some weeks ago ]
i really do find it hard that ` parliament ] would vote down an amendment not to fund coercive abortion not to fund infanticide
i personally have no difficulty with reproductive health support
it is when it comes to the abortion area i have difficulty for very good reasons and i would be happy to debate them
i am not something from the past
support the cause of those people in the % united kingdom ] who had relatives friends and loved ones blown up by [ semtex ] or killed by guns that were supplied by colonel } gaddafi ] and his murderous regime in % libya ]
there are too many to mention but also horizontal themes such as lgbt rights free expression rape as a war crime and the role of human rights defenders
in a sense the ` un human rights council ] is in a similar position to the % eu ] and it has to act as a global player
but both bodies suffer from the same problem a lack of credibility double standards at times and they are not able to act quickly enough
the % eu ] thus far has been unwilling to scrutinise its own human rights record sufficiently for example its participation in renditions and the lack of press freedom in some of our member states
until @ last week ] % libya ] was a member of the ` un human rights council ]
everything we are doing as the % european union ] aims at a peaceful and democratic solution to all these different layers of the crisis through credible and serious negotiations
the future of % venezuela ] should be determined by its people
in several meetings with our ) venezuelan ] interlocutors we have discussed the need to respect democratic principles democratic institutions human rights and fundamental freedoms
we see that the people of % venezuela ] are suffering including the many ) european union ] citizens who are also ) venezuelan ] citizens we have a stake in this
@ two months later ] the ` council ] recognised the lack of progress in the national dialogue and the worrying deterioration of the political and social situation in the country
we are exploring all possibilities to develop our support together with member states and also with other donors and partner agencies
no artificial conditions should be imposed to limit the participation of political parties
the recent decision of the government of % venezuela ] to declare the ) spanish ] ambassador persona non grata is wrong and unacceptable first and foremost because closing diplomatic channels does not help at a time when it is more important than ever to keep them open and seek a solution we expect the government of % venezuela ] to show genuine engagement in the negotiations and openness to compromise
these targeted restrictive measures do not harm the people of % venezuela ] but are directed at seven individuals who are responsible for undermining democratic principles and the rule of law and for human rights violations our measures are a signal to the authorities of % venezuela ] an invitation to engage seriously towards a negotiated solution to the crisis and to reverse the moves that have called into question
diseases such as malaria and diphtheria that had disappeared are now spreading across the country
it is a matter of political will
this is what the country needs in order to address the current challenges
more than ! one million ] people are currently food insecure and the percentage of children affected by global acute malnutrition has reached emergency levels
we need to see progress in the negotiations
it was with a heavy heart that member states decided to adopt targeted restrictive measures in the absence of concrete results and in view of the constant deterioration of the situation it is the ~ first ] time that we have imposed measures of this kind in a ) latin american ] context and the decision was not taken lightly as you can imagine
we do not take sides in % venezuela ] 's domestic debate but we do ask for this debate to be democratic and inclusive in line with the & constitution ] of the country
! one ] ! five million ] ) venezuelans ] have already left the country
these comprised a ban on the export of arms and equipment for internal repression and a framework decision for a travel ban and assets freeze
the lack of medicines is estimated at around ! ninety ] by the ` national chamber of pharmacists ]
i believe progress is still possible
both parties should agree on a mutually acceptable date for the presidential elections
and there are no signs of recovery from the economic crisis
it is in the hands of the parties as i mentioned the government has a clear responsibility to show flexibility and to engage seriously in these negotiations and we hope to see real concrete encouraging steps
it is also essential to set up guarantees to ensure free transparent and credible elections
we continue to monitor events on the ground and we stand ready to take appropriate measures in one way or another if the situation in the country evolves with the constant aim of supporting democratic and negotiated solutions
everything we do is to encourage and support the country to come out of this political economic and social crisis
as a consequence the ` council ] adopted a list of ! seven ] individuals subject to these measures
the reports we are receiving from the ` united nations ] agencies are extremely worrying
let me stress once again that we will adapt our policies to any change in the situation in % venezuela ] in one sense or the other
~ second ] call for an immediate end to % us ] imposed financial sanctions since starving the ) venezuelan ] economy of its foreign currency earnings risks turning the country 's current humanitarian crisis into a fullblown humanitarian catastrophe
the ! one ] and only way to overcome the deep polarisation of ) venezuelan ] society is renouncing violence in favour of negotiations towards an agreement
and ~ third ] urge the representatives of the opposition to return to talks with the government in a joint effort to reach agreement on the upcoming presidential elections
mr president the % eu ] must put its full support behind reaching an agreement at the talks between the ) venezuelan ] government and the opposition being hosted by the president of the % dominican republic ] to that end ~ first ] the % eu ] must reject in unequivocal terms the totally inadmissible threats by the % us ] president and his administration to launch a military intervention against % venezuela ]
malaria diphtheria and starvation in a nation with % venezuela ] 's resources or frankly in any nation this should not be
and from a crumbling economy and from political idealism failing as so often in history flow human rights abuses
i say this with a deep respect for the institutional and political internal dynamics but still recognising that what is happening there is not happening behind closed doors and concerns the international community
this concerns the % european union ] and this concerns many ) european union ] citizens
so it is in our interest for a solution to be found that can only be a political negotiated solution in a peaceful and constitutional outcome of the crisis
i mention that a peaceful and constitutional outcome of the crisis is a key element because there could be a different outcome
a different trend in the fleeing of ) venezuelans ] to neighbouring countries
that as many of you recalled might have a destabilising effect for different political situations in different countries that are also close to our hearts
let me stress ! one ] thing and i will close with this because i know we are running late the unity of the % european union ] and its member states is remarkable on this issue maybe more than it is in this chamber
but let me say the work we have done both in % venezuela ] and in % brussels ] has shown unity of purpose unity of action and coordinated efforts
i would like to thank the member states for this because this is what makes the difference when it comes to playing a role and making a difference again with respect with no interference
% venezuela ] is a sovereign country but when there is a political crisis when there is a social crisis when there is an economic crisis when there is a humanitarian crisis and also ) european ] interest and regional dynamics are at stake we have a duty to support a positive outcome to the ongoing efforts
a solution is possible we are not seeing this now but i believe that it is our duty to invest in this possibility
at the same time greater transparency and comparability of offered prices and services to consumers should be ensured
the ~ second ] is financial markets and the ~ third ] is local transport
the idea of a charter that would create a single piece of legislation covering consumer rights that are currently included in a number of ) european ] directives and numerous national implementation instruments was rejected for legal reasons
the energy consumer rights that are in the existing ) european ] legislation are already legally binding
@ two thousand and seven ] the results of the consultation showed that there was little knowledge of existing energy consumer rights
a very clear message should go out that this is extortionist
as stated it is up to the national authorities to enforce the relevant law and however critical we might be vis vis our ) european ] institutions i think that we need also to bear in mind that we are acting under the principle of subsidiarity and
@ two thousand and nine ] energy regulators and industry will report on the implementation of the billing recommendations in the next forum which is expected to be in @ the autumn ] of
market to the benefit of individual consumers the forum involving the representatives of consumers industry national energy regulators and national administrations seeks to improve implementation of energy legislation and may develop elements for codes of conduct with self regulating and even quasi binding effects
in this context a working group on billing was established at the ~ first ] meeting of the forum in
@ two thousand and eight ] the working group 's recommendations are examples of good billing practice and were presented and endorsed at the ~ second ] meeting of the forum in
internal energy market package the importance of the citizen in the internal energy market has been elevated considerably the new measures are intended to improve the operation of the retail energy market and provide additional consumer protection these topics are discussed and followed up at the # citizens energy forum ] established with the aim of improving the functioning of the retail
the harmonisation of the competences of energy regulators in relation to consumer protection which will result in active market monitoring will further enhance their protection
the commission is currently carrying out research and fact finding on information to consumers at the point of sale and it intends to consult retail experts consumer organisations and other stakeholders on the ground before proposing concrete measures
moreover the commission conducts information campaigns in member states who newly joined the % eu ] to raise awareness of consumer rights and promote national organisations and institutions where consumers can find further help and assistance
the commission promotes awareness of consumer rights through various instruments
in all member states there are institutions and organisations that have the task of promoting knowledge and understanding of consumer rights for their citizens
the centres websites leaflets and brochures explain to consumers what their rights are for example when shopping online renting a car or booking holidays in another member state
i could of course provide you with the website
an overview of these national institutions and organisations is available on the website
we sponsor an % eu ] wide network of consumer centres that provides consumers with information on their rights when shopping across borders and supports them with seeking redress when something goes wrong
the commission also promotes knowledge of rights through its consumer education initiatives such as the * europe ] diary that targets students aged between @ fifteen ] and @ eighteen ] and ` dolceta ] a website targeting adults and teachers
this directive if adopted will reduce the current fragmentation of the consumer acquis and ensure that all consumers in the % eu ] will benefit from a single simple set of consumer rights and this would make it easier to conduct pan ) european ] education campaigns on consumer rights
the aim of the regulation is precisely to ensure that nutrition and health claims made on foods are truthful clear and based on generally accepted scientific evidence so that the consumer is adequately protected
and ~ thirdly ] the member states which give their opinion on the measures in the regulatory committee
i must say we were amazed by the number of applications received
i look at my electricity bill i look at it with interest because i want to make these savings and frankly i find it confusing
please take this back to the commission and think again
i wonder therefore if the commissioner would agree with me that under the provisions of the & services directive ] for the cross border supply of services member states are explicitly encouraged to promote proper codes of conduct for cross border service supply
this seems to be exactly the sort of area where we should be encouraging member states perhaps facilitated by the commission to get the car rental operators together to produce a code of conduct that reputable operators would have to sign up to which would cover the issues that my colleagues are talking about plus other serious consumer issues as well
this is part of education and as we know education is very much in the hands of member states
i am very eager to continue in the ` european commission ] together with ` parliament ] to benchmark and measure how consumers are treated and how much member states invest in this policy i think it is a very good investment especially now in difficult economic times to see how consumers are treated because this gives good information about the market
the commission is well aware of this practice by car hire companies and has responded to a number of other parliamentary questions and citizens complaints about it
on the other hand these practices could be contrary to the & unfair commercial practices directive ] and the & unfair contract terms directive ]
~ first ] of all under the & unfair contract terms directive ] standard terms and conditions must not be significantly unbalanced to the detriment of consumers moreover contract terms should be drafted in plain and intelligible language
it may be argued that a clause resulting in consumers paying in practice for something they have not consumed is unfair
~ secondly ] the & unfair commercial practices directive ] obliges traders to live up to the standard of professional diligence traders must be open and up front about the main characteristics of the service provided
this practice might also be considered as contrary to the standard of professional diligence which this directive requires traders to live up to
however the honourable member should be aware that it is up to national enforcement authorities to determine whether such practices are unfair and to pursue the offending companies
the commission does not have any enforcement powers
consumers who have purchased cross border services can however complain to the ) european ] consumer centre in their home country which should be able to help them receive redress from traders in other % eu ] countries
i had the privilege of working with mr } harbour ] which i very much enjoyed so please let me thank you specifically and personally for this opportunity over the @ last three years ]
i think that ! one ] of these missing links is the retail market
initially i was a bit taken aback by the opening remarks of the commissioner but then he clarified the situation
there are great opportunities there to develop tourism right throughout the % european union ] and i am quite happy to work with the commission and to do anything we can because it is an opportunity
mr president i particularly wanted to be here this evening because i think that this is mrs } kuneva ] 's last opportunity to speak to us as commissioner and i wanted to pose ! two ] questions ~ first ] of all would she agree with me that consumer information and sweeps and her work have been dramatically increased during her tenure
we are talking now about health claims
when a producer makes a claim that a product is good for your health for this or that reason then it has to be scientifically substantiated that this really is so
that is straightforward best practice
these are matters of national sovereignty and the freedom of the voters not the % eu ]
the failings of the railway package are laughable and the share of freight being moved by rail has actually fallen since the ~ first ] railway package in
was anything enforced
the commission will not enforce the regulations on battery cages for hens which may well force producers who have complied out of business so what is this about enforcement
some pay fines then continue to break the same rule because the annual revenue collected exceeds the amount of the annual % eu ] fine
the legislation does not require clarification or improvement
the report criticises member states for lack of investment to meet this package but we are in a middle of an economic crisis
@ two thousand and one ] are the % eu ] regulations enforced
will cash strapped national governments pay their fines
the commission has taken ! thirteen ] member states to the ` european court of justice ] for failing to correctly implement various parts of the railway package
here the % eu ] sought control over national policy making decisions on railways for example stopping the political will to run nationalised railways
due to kowtowing to % brussels ] measures are implemented which are not often beneficial to the ) british ] public and are exercised with considerable difficulty there is also an argument that for safety reasons it would be more beneficial for railway maintenance and locomotive operators not to be commercially separate
i have already confirmed on several occasions my intention to propose further substantial reform in the rail sector @ next year ]
however some amendments would restrict their interventions to cases of discrimination and impede interventions to correct other undesirable distortions of the market
the commission will present its work programme for @ two thousand and twelve ] @ tomorrow ]
~ secondly ] debt write off by member states can only relate to so called historical debt incurred before market opening
i am fully aware that discussions in both ` council ] and ` parliament ] proved to be difficult and subject to intense lobbying from various stakeholders
the ~ second ] would put an unnecessary administrative burden on infrastructure managers ~ seventhly ] amendments restricting or removing powers for the commission to adopt delegated or implementing acts often relate to non essential elements we need to make technical adjustments which practically should not be done in co decision
new exemptions to infrastructure charging cannot be justified by any objective criteria
in some cases some of the principles and rules already agreed @ ten years ago ] have been challenged in an attempt to undermine ongoing infringement procedures
~ fifthly ] experience shows that the competence of national regulators must be extended
these amendments would be a step backward compared to the text agreed by ` council ] and even compared to existing law which is not acceptable for the commission let me insist on some of these ~ first ] the issue of separation between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings will be subject to new proposals at the @ end of two thousand and twelve ] and therefore all amendments in relation to & articles six ] and
in * europe ] as a whole these are the basic points
it is the % uk ] 's leading business organisation
& amendment two ] highlights the recent trend of companies towards returning production and services to * europe ] and the opportunities this brings for job creation
so my report on creating a hospitable environment for business covers a number of areas
small businesses create { eighty five per cent ] of all new jobs in * europe ] and employ ! two thirds ] of the workforce
skills to compete and succeed globally we need a workforce with the skills that the market needs
we must recognise that some businesses fail but those with the courage and vision to have started them have learned from the experience and should not be written off
and i would like to pay tribute to an organisation which speaks on behalf of smes
improved quality control and shorter lead times make the case for reshoring even stronger
it is exciting inspiring and challenging to set up your own business and to contribute to the economy
i hope that colleagues will support this report as an important step forward to creating a more hospitable environment for job creation in * europe ] and i look forward to the debate ahead
this of course should not come at the expense of workers health and safety and that is something i would like to clarify before we go any further in this debate
by making it simpler and easier to understand and implement regulations we increase compliance and safety
i think it is fair to say that we have managed to strike a good balance
we have reached agreement on a number of issues including how the % eu ] and member states can improve access to finance promote entrepreneurship and develop better regulation
i believe all of us here can agree that in order to address unemployment levels in * europe ] we need to look at new innovative ways in which the % eu ] can contribute to creating an environment that supports businesses and gives them confidence to invest and grow
initially with the & small businesses act ] and more recently the think small ~ first ] principle the sme test the refit programme and the top ten initiative which has identified the top ! ten ] most burdensome % eu ] laws for smes while acknowledging the broad spectrum of political views on some of the issues addressed in this report
my ambition is not to reduce the protection of workers or their rights but it is to reduce the red tape
we must create the right regulatory environment one that will protect workers but at the same time will allow businesses to grow innovate and ultimately create jobs here in * europe ]
the report covers demographics market access finance labour markets smes and micro enterprises and better regulation
the roots of this report are based on the fact that smes and micro enterprises currently provide ! ninety million ] jobs in the private sector in the % eu ]
it is estimated that ! two hundred ] ! zero ] jobs could be created @ in the next few years ] as companies return activities to the % uk ] and other parts of * europe ]
entrepreneurship is at the heart of a competitive * europe ] in a world of fast growing economies
i believe that our economies have a unique opportunity to accelerate this trend of reshoring jobs and that member states together with the commission must take concrete steps to help businesses capitalise
entrepreneurship it is troubling that the number of % eu ] citizens who want to be self employed has dropped from ! forty five ] to ! thirty seven ] in the @ last three years ]
investing in skills and making sure employment and social law is flexible manageable and created with small businesses in mind while ensuring a level playing field across the % eu ]
therefore the ) european ] institutions and the member states must establish a culture of entrepreneurship for businesses to start up survive and grow while being able to remain competitive in today 's global markets
the cost and complexity of starting up a business must be reduced
it is the ` federation of small businesses ]
along with ! eighty four ] other meps i have tabled a plenary amendment which i really hope you can all support
i have here their call to ) european ] politicians in their manifesto for the elections coming up
we differ however on how to go about it
i feel this is unlikely
personally i left home this morning at
if you are a small business person you spend all day doing the real job and then you have to be the accountant the lawyer and the hr specialist at night
mr president we have heard a number of very key points in this debate ~ firstly ] that businesses particularly smes must be equipped and supported with knowledge and know how on how to access much needed finance for example through ! one ] stop shops and web portals
the ` federation of small businesses ] tells us that the ) european ] market with its ! five hundred million ] customers is very attractive for small firms
i am grateful to mr } rbig ] for raising that particular issue that the whole matter of becoming an entrepreneur is what we need to teach people
it is up to us as legislators to cut the red tape and the burden on businesses
it is our job to cut that bit so that the business can concentrate on its core role of creating wealth growing and being able to employ more people
i hope that we can all unite in calling for the cutting of red tape and the increasing of business opportunities to create jobs and let our companies thrive
this report makes a significant contribution to this debate by focusing on the importance of entrepreneurship something which i myself have been advocating should play a bigger role in education for at least @ two decades ] and also creating the right climate for smes notably by looking closely at the regulatory burden which we impose upon them
for example the ) greens ] do not seem to think that we should make sure that our education and training systems adapt to business needs through stem skills nor that the free trade agreements provide opportunities for investment and jobs
the ) socialists ] do not seem to think that social partner agreements should be subject to democratic controls
we should be aiming for an efficient % union ] which keeps the better regulation agenda at its core so we need to include all the positive elements in this report
this has many great advantages only ! one ] bank account will be needed for the whole * euro area ]
she would like to thank the representatives of the ` council ] commissioner } barnier ] the chair of the ` econ committee ] ms } bowles ] the shadow rapporteurs and all those who proposed amendments and contributed to this excellent result as well as the ` econ ] secretariat which
since moving to sepa has been too slow in the past this regulation sets a clear end date for the transition
consumers will have real options to compare prices and get the best price
buying a computer from the cheapest % eu ] retailer may save ( hundreds of euros ] making prices go down everywhere in the single market therefore * sepa ] is in many ways essential for a well functioning internal market
* sepa ] is good news at present concerning the euro and the % eu ] it will open up national markets to competition and make the payment sector more effective
a member state may also allow consumers to use their old bank account number instead of ibans for @ two extra years ]
easy payments also make it very easy to buy goods and services via the internet from all over the % eu ]
makes our work possible the completion of the * single european payment area ] is of great importance for the ) european ] internal market and has numerous benefits for our citizens
if a person is working abroad he or she will not need a new bank account in that country and may receive his or her salary to the one bank account in his or her own home country
with * sepa ] only ! one ] bank account is needed for the whole * euro area ] by using the international bank account number or iban
sorry but we need to change * europe ] needs to change
we need to strengthen our economic position in the world payments are the lubricant of the single market certainly with a view to e commerce and therefore i hope that all the member states will meet the deadlines which are very generous
quite frankly if you listen to the benefits that we expect to get from * sepa ] it is completely incomprehensible why it has to take so long why there are such long transition periods and why there are so many exemptions
we are in the middle of an economic crisis
we need to complete the internal market
for instance a capital increase of ( eur ten billion ] would allow the ` eib ] to lend approximately ( eur sixty billion ] which in turn would attract other financing sources for a total investment of ( eur one hundred and eighty billion ]
to provide without any delay additional capital to the ` european investment bank ]
the ` eib ] with a lending capacity several times the size of the ` world bank ] has been playing a key role in tackling the crisis since @ two thousand and eight ] but it is reaching the limits of what it can do with its current capital base
for new projects of infrastructure innovation and so on
i sent a letter to these governments in order to encourage them to reconsider their decisions and in the forthcoming employment package we also point to the importance of this
so my question is why do you want to make it an exhaustive list and why do you not change the logic of the ` ecb ] instead of aligning with it when it comes to control measures
governments have to address these situations
indeed the objective is fully in line with the commission 's belief that we have to create a dynamic and inclusive labour market
especially to open up competition in product and services markets to improve the business environment and to make better use of structural funds for investment will be crucial in delivering their full benefits
each member has > one minute ] to put his or her question and > thirty seconds ] to put a supplementary
the commission has > two minutes ] to reply if only ! one ] commissioner is to be responsible for answering if more than ! one ] commissioner is to reply each commissioner has > one minute ] 's speaking time
there was a reference in the forthcoming employment package to the continuing work on restructuring and we will soon after evaluating these summaries decide on what the next follow up should be we will of course coordinate with the social partners about this decision but let me just finally mention that there is also an important financial implication because in such situations the governments can request the globalisation adjustment fund if the conditions apply
this discussion has a certain history with strong involvement by the social partners the trade unions and on the other side the employers having strong views especially because in the crisis period there have been heavy implications as a result of corporate relocations
in this phase the commission is summarising the answers
i think such examples provide lessons for how to develop this discussion
yes indeed this is a very important initiative and a very practical initiative of the ` european commission ]
i would like to ask the commissioner whether he does not think it is going a little bit too far to take this to ) european ] level considering that most member states do not have these provisions in their whole legal framework
this applies particularly to those member states that have developed economies based on large numbers of very specialised contractors
in fact these contractors are largely thought of as suppliers
perhaps that dimension should be looked at in % slovakia ] and strengthened in the coming period when i have an opportunity to meet officials of the new government i will certainly raise this point
well i think that we disagree on that interpretation but we can probably discuss that in the future in a follow up
is the commission satisfied with the explanation you received from the member states which are still keeping the restrictions claiming that our presence will distort the labour market
we have about > half an hour ] left and i have too many questions for that time
i think it is also important to note that most of the famous so called controversial cases in the history of the posting of workers in * europe ] come from countries or areas where this liability regime is not applied
however when exercising their power the member states must comply with % union ] law in particular the provisions of the treaty on the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services
the court clearly stated that the right to strike does not fall outside the scope of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services
i can also add that the regulation lays down general principles with respect to the exercise of the right to strike within the context of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services
i just wanted to point that out
however the freedom to provide services must also be respected
in order to provide for legal certainty the & enforcement directive ] indicates clearly which control measures are proportionate and justified
most of the % uk ] 's energy network is now operated by non ) british ] firms
in my own constituency of % wales ] ` rwe ] a ) german ] company recently spent ( gbp four hundred and fifty million ] on non renewable energy generation and a further ( billion pounds ] on a state of the art gas power station in % pembrokeshire ]
however we ended up voting for the ) socialist ] amendment which i believe will not work well
after all savings are good in any language or i would think for any political party
the ` parliament ] pays out over ( eur fifteen million ] per year on translations for ! twenty four ] languages and worse still in @ two thousand and twelve ] the ` parliament ] wasted eur
i welcome this report which proposed a system of interpretation on demand
for their benefit i will try to speak slowly avoid jokes and refrain from littering my speeches with quotations from } shakespeare ]
it is a shame that this house has missed an opportunity to save more money
to regain the public 's confidence in the industry now it is absolutely essential that a zero tolerance approach is taken and that those found to be abusing the system are criminally prosecuted this proposal under ms } mccarthy ] 's report will introduce fines of up to ! fifty ] of turnover for companies that commit unlawful behaviour as well as providing the option of imposing bans on operating but i believe that custodial sentences also need to be considered
such importance however should not exclude the industry from supervision and effective policing and regulation where necessary
streamline the interpretation and translation given in committee meetings while guaranteeing and i think this is really important that the principle of multilingualism is not compromised by any changes made
investing in energy efficiency measures can bring about immediate and tangible benefits for both households and business in industry such as reduction of costs creation of employment opportunities and growth as well as an encouragement in the transition towards a low carbon economy
that said we are facing a severe challenge to meeting the objective of reducing the overall energy consumption by ! twenty ] by @ two thousand and twenty ] where policies fostering energy efficiency could and should play a stronger role
mr president i voted in favour of this report because we must continue to make sure that energy efficiency is at the very centre of many of our % eu ] policies
being energy efficient is very important in terms of getting it right from the very start of new projects
energy efficiency improvements are decisive for ) european ] competitiveness and represent a win win option in the fight against climate change
with ! twenty four ] official languages the ` european parliament ] 's interpretation services have to cover a total of ! five hundred and fifty two ] language combinations
adopting this officially would only serve to bring more transparency and dynamism to the workings of ` parliament ] and send a signal to % eu ] citizens that the % eu ] is serious in its aim to make efficient and budgetary savings
the ` un ] with one ! hundred and ninety three ] member states operates with just ! six ] and the ! forty seven ] member state ` council of europe ] has just ! two ] official languages
mr president the % eu ] has ! twenty eight ] member states and ! twenty four ] official languages
working towards a more efficient and cost effective interpretation process is of course welcome but the recommendations do not offer the radical solution which would be the logical step for an expanding supranational institution such as the % eu ]
however these proposals are not as bad as they could have been thanks to the intervention of ) conservative ] meps
at a time when it is difficult enough to get your feet on the property market it should not be up to the % eu ] to decide whether or not parents help their children with their mortgages
at least we prevented a range of unintended consequences for the ) uk ] mortgage market
as previous speakers have said the importance of the report cannot be overstated in view of the fact that a mortgage is often the most important and longest financial commitment a family makes
as we know transport is the backbone of the ) european ] economy without it the tourism industry could not exist manufacturers could not get their goods to market and life would be impossible
it is crucial that we reduce the impact of transport on climate change while at the same time contributing to improving the health of % eu ] citizens and their quality of life
we must not look negatively on the need to reduce the impact of transport on our environment but rather see it as an opportunity because jobs can be created in the r d sector while at the same time we are meeting our environmental targets
mr president in all sectors across the % eu ] maximising our research and innovation potential means we can deliver competitive high quality and sustainable services and the transport sector is no exception
however the principle of subsidiarity must remain foremost in our consideration of the commission 's communication on ) european ] transport technology strategy
i am concerned that this report points to the initiatives which would be best formulated and executed by the member states themselves
most mortgages are local to the country from which the applicant derives
every country in the % eu ] has its own culture as regards home ownership and that should be respected but consumer protection should be the defining principle when considering cross border rules and the compatibility of national systems i congratulate mr } snchez presedo ] on his report on this issue although i still have concerns about how the directive is likely to be implemented across the % eu ]
mr president i welcome this report because it is very badly needed in order to enhance investor protection and confidence in the markets and confidence is all important the report would establish a common regulatory framework on market abuse to ensure the integrity of financial markets in the % union ]
the proposal extends the scope of the market abuse framework applying to any financial institution or instrument admitted to trading
there will be no place hopefully as a result of this for market abusers to hide within the % european union ]
the regulation will lay down a set of administrative procedures sanctions and fines to ensure a common approach in the member states
also the directive will introduce a requirement for all member states to put in place effective proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions for the most serious insider dealing and trading and market manipulation offences
such a strategy would give a very welcome boost to the development of sustainable economic activities in the region which will have a beneficial effect on coastal communities and adjacent inland areas properly managed fisheries provide employment in some of the most rural and remote parts of the % european union ] and when sensibly managed this is a renewable resource that is very valuable in the fight against unemployment in many isolated parts of the % eu ]
mr president in what remains a difficult economic time across the % eu ] it is absolutely essential that we ensure that every penny of % eu ] funding is spent in the most cost effective manner possible
however as outlined in @ today ] 's report strategic use of ) european ] structural and investment funds could drive private investment in energy efficiency across * europe ] and support member states in their efforts to increase their energy efficiency
the most successful and effective initiatives will i believe be those that complement member states individual efforts to increase energy efficiency with targeted investments of % eu ] funds that contribute to overall growth and job creation within our individual regions
as previous speakers have said ` parliament ] has unsuccessfully called @ for many years ] for the need to strengthen procedural rights stressing the need to strike the right balance between the freedom of justice and security this report finally recognises an overarching principle of basic human and criminal law at % eu ] level
despite the existence of common principles and minimum standards stemming both from the & echr ] and the & eu charter ] provisions governing access to a lawyer vary significantly from one member state to another and this report introduces a level playing field and a measure of consistency
in a borderless * europe ] citizens have to be confident that their rights are fully respected and that their security is provided when they are travelling
mr president i am hugely sceptical about the practical implementation of the ) european ] arrest warrant by member states having heard personal stories from my constituents in % wales ] where the arrest warrant has been used to make them face spurious charges under different legal systems of questionable legitimacy in other parts of * europe ] particularly in less regulated sectors such as the construction industry
i have serious concerns and see this directive as a step forward towards ensuring that when the ) european ] arrest warrant is indeed used the basic rights of citizens across * europe ] such as access to lawyers the confidentiality of all communications with them and access to diplomatic authorities are properly upheld
we cannot create ) european ] systems without the necessary protections and safeguards that have been built into national law @ for centuries ]
to make the ) european ] arrest warrant work in practice we need to learn from the experiences gained across member states to date and ensure that individual countries do not and cannot abuse their privileges
he said that it means the socially constructed roles and behaviours that a society considers appropriate for women and men
we are not going to quit until women are free from violence
@ last june ] i proudly represented ` parliament ] at the signature of the % eu ] accession to the convention a historic step towards preventing those horrible crimes combating impunity and protecting victims
it defines violence done to a woman just because she is a woman based on sexism and discrimination
it is violence that endangers families not the convention
it is not against the traditional family
@ today ] we call on the % eu ] and the ` council of europe ] to do more in dialogue with member states on the issue of gender engaging with civil society religious groups and women ngos we call on the presidency to put this issue on the agenda of the ` european council ] for as long as it takes and we call on % bulgaria ] to reopen the ratification process
the convention is the only binding treaty that criminalises violence against women and domestic violence
the ` council of europe ] commissioner for human rights recently clarified that the arguments pretending that the word gender has hidden purposes are simply not true
they are doing that because they want to push forward their ideology of taking away our rights
we will be the generation of feminists that will make sure that women are protected from gender based violence all over the % european union ] we will ratify the & istanbul convention ] all over the % european union ] and make sure that there is an end to gender based violence
the suffragettes @ one hundred years ago ] in many parts of * europe ] fought for the right of women to vote
we will not give up
madam president colleagues let 's face it we are experiencing a major backlash on women 's rights in the % european union ]
that is simply not the case anymore because we see attacks on women 's rights all over the % european union ] and those who are attacking women 's rights have now chosen the # istanbul convention ] as ! one ] of the battlefields in this discussion
they concern the fear that ratifying the convention would mean forcing states to allow same sex marriage or to introduce a new refugee status for transgender or intersex persons
the convention is about preventing and combating violence against women without other hidden purposes it is not an instrument for shaping gender perceptions or ideologies
the commission 's intention is to conclude full % eu ] ratification as soon as possible
despite the fact that all % eu ] countries have signed the convention and ! seventeen ] have so far ratified it we see strong opposition against ratification in a few countries
on the prevention and protection of victims of gender based violence
we are all familiar with the figures from the age of @ fifteen ] ! one ] in ! three ] women in * europe ] has been a victim of physical violence sexual violence or both
i would like to thank the ` european parliament ] for constantly speaking out alongside the commission about the importance of ratifying the & council of europe convention ] on prevention and protection of victims of gender based violence
let me be very clear on this
i sincerely hope that those member states that still have doubts about joining the convention will consider its fundamental purpose to prevent violence against women and to support and protect those women who fall victim to violence
nowhere in the convention is it stated that a new refugee status should be established for transgender or intersex persons or for any other group
in fact no reference is made to the legal recognition of same sex marriages this subject is outside of the scope of the convention
for example these concern the use and translation of the term gender
when i speak with women 's rights defenders from all over the world i realise how lucky we are to have such an instrument in * europe ]
this is why i find it appalling that this convention 's ratification is so problematic in some member states including my own
the fact that governments are reluctant to ratify this key instrument shows how little they care about women 's safety
in these cases i say that not to do so will cost women 's lives
in % bulgaria ] the use of transphobic and homophobic arguments against this convention is very disappointing
i call on the ) bulgarian ] government to revise its position on this crucial issue and stand by the & istanbul convention ]
it will make our society a safer place for women and girls
we have to do everything in our power to stop violence against women and to support the victims
of our party or personal views we are all parliamentarians and one of the most important powers we have is the ability to hold the executive to account through parliamentary pqs but these pqs are now being treated with contempt by the services questions are not receiving proper answers they are evasive incomplete and dismissive and the timescale for answering is frequency exceeded rule
as far back as i can remember } mugabe ] has acted in this way retaining a veneer of democracy whilst acting in a despotic and undemocratic way
we have seen assets of } mugabe ] frozen yet at the same time a large amount of money is being sent to % zimbabwe ] in aid and we need to make absolutely sure that we know what we are doing that we know why it is being done and that we ensure that money is not going to the wrong places
the % eu ] is committed to fighting discrimination to preserving the rights of individuals to enjoy the full range of human rights in % zimbabwe ] and we are determined to continue supporting the work of civil society organisations and protecting human rights activists
continued political and economic reforms are essential to restore growth and achieve inclusive and sustainable development
it is essential that they are free to operate in an environment that protects fundamental human rights and freedoms as set out in & zimbabwe 's constitution ]
our overall objective remains to re engage fully with a stable and democratic % zimbabwe ]
we welcome the positive ruling at the ` high court ] to grant bail and we take careful note of the judge 's remarks about the weakness of the state 's case
the right of pastor } mawarire ] to express his views and opinions in a peaceful manner is a fundamental freedom enshrined in % zimbabwe ] 's own & constitution ]
respect for the rule of law human rights and the consolidation of democracy are also essential the electoral commission should engage with all parties to agree on an electoral framework for the @ two thousand and eighteen ] elections
i would like to recall the % eu ] 's continuing commitment to the people of % zimbabwe ] and emphasise that the % eu ] remains amongst the most important donors to that country
the case has been raised with the government at senior level and we will continue to follow developments closely
% zimbabwe ] is at a critical juncture as a number of you have said
human rights defenders organisations and activists are playing a critical role in the promotion of human rights in % zimbabwe ]
they deserve recognition and credit for their significant and persistent contribution
i have been in this ` parliament ] for @ eighteen years ] and throughout this time have campaigned for effective action against } mugabe ] and for freedom for the ) zimbabwean ] people
in fact the country is bankrupt and its people in despair and yet the grand architect of this misery } robert mugabe ] continues in power
the administration has not contacted meps to tell them about the problem and wait for it i hope you are looking for a bit of a laugh here i had been told that i would be informed by email when my emails are back
we do not know when speaking time is happening we do not know when our appointments are happening and this is happening to up to ! fifty ] ! sixty ] people in here
this is why in these difficult moments for the % european union ] it is so important that we think of our common responsibilities towards our citizens and towards the rest of the world
there is not ! one ] single thing be it counter terrorism be it trade be it development be it migration management there is not ! one ] single issue where we are stronger alone than stronger together
we do not have to be afraid of our added value even when it is a partial one
threats are global opportunities are global all of our countries compared to the rest of the countries in the world are small sized countries at the maximum medium sized countries we are not living in the era of empires anymore not for @ a couple of centuries ]
it is a part of the strategy that was carefully thought of as you can imagine and it responds to the fact that on ! one ] side we need to keep the unity not only of the ! twenty eight ] member states but also the different institutions including this ` parliament ] and this is what is done
it is now also a matter of turning this into practice so that is why i think that the package we adopted @ yesterday ] is something that is going to be extremely important in our capacity to implement also part of the strategy using our different instruments keeping in mind that they are different and covering different areas but in a coherent and integrated way
so i hope that we can indeed as some of you said use a strategy to turn our common vision and action into those of a self confident global player
this simply says that we need to use our resources in a coherent way and respond to the needs of the populations we are working with and all the messages we are getting are in the sense that we need to also work on security as we continue to work on development
the point here is whether we want to react to a change that is produced somewhere else or if we are confident enough to try and shape the change that is happening around us and i believe that we have all the tools all the strength if we have the political will to do it exactly as our citizens have an interest in us doing this
i am sorry but i am not going to hear those voices in this field because if there is one field where it is self evident that the security of the ) european ] citizens require ) european ] action it is our work in the world
our strength is our % european union ] in the world and our partners around the world see it very clearly and recognise our strengths in the world
~ first ] of all some asked whether we stress more the values or the interests and whether we define more as an important element of our action in the future our values or our interests
there is ! one ] element in our values that the strategy underlines which is that to make our action consistent we have to be true to our values ~ first ] of all in our internal policies and in our own behaviour and this is something that echoes also some of the elements that some of you
any global strategy starts at home and any external credibility is rooted in our internal strength
resilience of societies around us is indeed an investment in our own security and when we mention resilience of societies in the strategy we do not mention the strength of institutions only but we mention the resilience of societies as such which includes the space for civil society human rights defenders
the important thing is that this is done in a coordinated manner with a clear transparent link to common decisions and with common approaches and reporting back to the common instances
there is no single field in our external action where one member state alone whether it is the biggest the strongest the richest the smallest is more effective alone than all together
the basic need we have now is to guarantee that the ) european ] citizens are guaranteed their right to security and this requires the % european union ] to act as a % european union ] united
what we sometimes do not do is recognise this strength inside our % union ] but we have to come out of this sort of depression we have entered and make use of our strength because you can be strong but if you know you are strong you do not use your strength and it is useless
we always say there is no security without development but there is no development without security
you have to listen to those who say the ) european ] way is not the way
i think this is the basic thing we have to do now
this does not mean that again we are diverting resources from one chapter to the other
things change in a way that was unforeseeable just @ a few months or years ago ]
on the contrary this is a response to what especially our ) african ] friends not only governments and institutions but also civil society are telling us that if in a territory be it in the * sahel ] be it in % nigeria ] be it in the * horn of africa ] if you have a lack of basic security conditions for the populations you can do all the development you want
@ yesterday ] the college as you might know adopted the package on capacity building on security and development and let me tell you very clearly this is not at all a diversion of our development tools into a security or military approach
in the framework of the common institutions but there might be occasions where we might want or we might need or we might want to encourage ! one ] or a group of member states or why not
the important thing is that all of this is in a common framework and towards a common goal
and we have to wake up to reality
citizens look to their elected representatives to ensure the planning for their protection is efficient and reliable and in place
we have been promised progress in setting up a network of competent national services in member states
its information assists mariners aircraft and emergency planners from a range of real time sources around the world but we need more than these sorts of facilities
@ two thousand and nine ] national authorities should now be requested to put core equipment on standby available for rapid ) european ] assistance when needed
we need to know where the emergency food supplies the tents and the blankets are
the commission must come forward with these plans now
we need to know where the facilities are that will save the lives of citizens of our % union ] when they need them
rainfall is more erratic and we have more droughts causing life threatening fires across our continent hardly a country has escaped a natural disaster in @ the last few years ] and this is not counting the man made catastrophes such as # chernobyl ] and more recently the toxic dam in % hungary ]
we need to know where the trained emergency service teams are
we have had many promises and reports from the commission yet little concrete action has been forthcoming
a map of assets that is readily available and ready to use when disaster strikes was promised in
at the same time ensuring cost effective and increased investment in disaster prevention is a challenge we are now assessing the effectiveness of existing % eu ] financing instruments we are also developing a catalogue of prevention measures that would be considered by member states for % eu ] funding our objective is to increase the impact of % eu ] funding and to accelerate the implementation of regional fund support
actions are also under way to improve our knowledge of disasters we have worked with the ` european environment agency ] on a report assessing the frequency of disasters in * europe ] and their impact on humans the economies and ecosystems
the disasters of @ last year ] were a salutary reminder that the % eu ] and its member states need to step up work on disaster prevention
we are also looking at innovative financing instruments such as insurance pooling to share risks effective investments in disaster prevention will help to save lives limit damages and ultimately save money
we all know that investing in disaster prevention pays off
the increased frequency and intensity of disasters in * europe ] should also provide further incentives for member states to invest in preparedness and build up their capacity
mr president there is much talk about buzz words here @ today ] but the key buzz word is the ~ first ] word up on the board prevention
as the old adage says prevention is better than cure and certainly we have to try and prevent natural disasters based on recent trends to get out some kind of a forecast and to put preventive actions in place
finally i want to ask how many countries can actually say that they have complied with the commission 's recommendations especially in relation to the & floods directive ]
i know it has not been applied properly in my country
countries have to take responsibility just the same as the commission
the efsi provides a ~ first ] loss guarantee so that the ` eib ] has been able to invest in more risky projects
the ` european investment bank ] and ` european commission ] admitted many times and i quote the efsi projects portfolio risk profile will be higher than the average risk profile of the other ` eib ] projects and assets
one should ask oneself why do we need such an investment fund at a time when interest rates are already extremely low and the market is flooded with cheap money
the european fund for strategic investments is explicitly funding risky projects projects that are not able to obtain funding through the financial markets at a time when money is easy
besides funding projects in the field of energy efsi is often used to fund semi governmental infrastructure projects which are harmful to private business
if you look at the countries and regions which have benefited the most from efsi you can see that local authorities and also private banks and meps have been actively promoting the opportunities which efsi can offer i can give you some examples of very active meps
in other terms according to the ` european investment bank ] efsi investments made up to now will increase ) european ] gdp by
of them ~ first ] there is a more precise definition of additionally and ~ second ] investment decisions will be better explained and the scoreboard on which they are based will be published this is a measure of transparency and also of increased accountability
in % finland ] efsi supports the ~ first ] ever social impact points scheme in * europe ] the scheme will support the integration of up to ! three ] ! seven hundred ] migrants and refugees in the ) finnish ] labour market through training and job matching assistance
so far before i conclude i would like to highlight that much still remains to
in other terms it will create new jobs and new financing opportunities for infrastructure investments and smes
efsi two zero will better focus % on ] eu political priorities such as climate change and environmental
let me give you some concrete examples of efsi projects
in % greece ] the ` eib ] is lending to a telecoms operator to roll out high speed broadband bringing better internet access to rural and remote areas of the country
thanks to ` parliament ] 's efforts the scoreboard of indicators will be made public after the signature of each project and the investment committee will substantiate its decision on the granting of % eu ]
let me outline some
based on feedback received and numerous expressions of interest such support is clearly deemed useful even necessary
transparency is crucial to all
this means less poverty and less social exclusion
their support is a key success
we have been able to assist governments with their public finance management implementation of administrative judiciary and health care reforms development of capital markets and access to finance
we support the involvement of the social partners and civil society in the preparation and implementation of reforms
we should not forget that some of the technical assistance will go towards important areas and important policies such as education and training
that is why structural funds are so important when we talk about structural reforms structural funds are an investment in all the things i have just mentioned
therefore my group believes it is important that the new reform programmes align with cohesion policy aims because we are using cohesion policy funds
there will be less money for all programmes including structural funds so those of us who want to protect structural funds have to make this point now
the ` sd group ] believes that structural funds have always been ! one ] of the most important policies of the % european union ] and should be in the future
if we want new programmes and new initiatives then we have to find other ways of funding them
it should be about changing an economy to promote jobs and growth to promote research and development and to promote education and training
@ today ] we are talking about using technical assistance to support structural reforms in member states this will be on a voluntary basis
we also think it is important that parliament receive the support plans and monitoring reports so that we as a democratic body can look at the progress which is being made
structural reforms should be about positive things and about changing an economy in a positive way
these are the type of things we can use structural funds for in order to improve growth across the % european union ]
i want to start my contribution by making a general point about structural reforms
we also believe it is important that local and regional governments are involved in the reform process so that their needs are met mr } van nistelrooij ] mentioned this in his contribution as well
we also believe that it is important from a budget point of view that this programme which redirects structural funds does not set a precedent for the future
all these things are important those are the type of structural reforms that i think we should be supporting
when in some member states the structural funds have become almost the only source of public investment the way in which this money will be spent becomes absolutely crucial
yes this proposal could have been shaped as a powerful instrument to say to these member states you go through difficult times and we will support you unfortunately this chance has been missed
for my group this proposal is far too unspecific in the aims it should reach for member states and could thus become a tool to impose unwanted structural reforms in the member states rather than supporting member states in difficult situations
the commission will analyse those requests ensuring equal treatment
how right he was and how that power has shifted when } kohl ] and } mitterrand ] came here representing their countries @ twenty five years ago ] it was a partnership of equals but no longer % france ] is now severely diminished trapped inside a currency from which frankly it cannot recover and the ) french ] voice in this relationship and in * europe ] is little more now frankly than a pipsqueak
well there is i think a bright star on the horizon
i hope and pray that % britain ] voting to leave the % european union ] will be the beginning of the end of a project which however noble its original intentions has gone rotten
it is called the ) british ] referendum and given that none of you want to concede % britain ] the ability to take back control of our own borders a # brexit ] now looks more likely than at any point in modern time
and when we have a general election that says a country like % greece ] wants to change direction well i am sorry but that now must be brushed aside because the ) germans ] do not want it
in what must count as perhaps the worst piece of public policy seen in modern * europe ] @ for half a century ] when you compounded the already failing and flawed % eu ] common asylum policy by saying to the whole world please come to * europe ] and we saw frankly virtually a stampede and we learn that ! eighty ] of those that are coming are not ) syrian ] refugees in fact what you have done is to open the door to young male economic migrants many of whom i have to say behave in a rather aggressive manner quite the opposite to what you would ever expect to see from any refugee
you said * europe ] is not working so we must have more * europe ] more of the same failing
it is an irony is it not that a project that was designed to contain ) german ] power has now given us a totally ) german ] dominated * europe ]
day so it was your decision to suspend the & schengen ] rules and to open the ) german ] border and it was your decision to close the border
turning to the issue of migration and refugees again a similar
this has lasted long enough and it cannot go on forever
we cannot really talk to one another using that kind of language
will i urge you to be more responsive to reality
with this is not the language of dialogue
however it recalls that & article two hundred and ninety ] is to be interpreted as meaning that the commission is autonomous in the preparation and adoption of delegated acts
accordingly reference to consultation of experts should be contained in a recital not in the enacting terms
mr president i think that we are all aware of the threat posed to public safety by terrorists
the commission proposed this regulation @ two years ago ]
however there is ! one ] institutional point of continued disagreement relating to the preparation of delegated acts and on this point i would like to make the following declaration on behalf of the commission
the commission is ready to do its part notably by issuing guidelines on implementation before the new rules are applied which means @ eighteen months ] after the regulation enters into force
@ today ] we are dealing with ! one ] aspect how to make it more difficult for violent extremists to obtain the ingredients for home made explosives
the commission regrets that this principle was not respected and underlines that the present case cannot constitute a precedent i hope however that @ tomorrow ] there will be a positive vote so that the ` council ] can formally adopt the legislation @ before the end of the year ]
the commission takes note of the agreement reached by co legislators on & article ninety one ] as well as the unanimity in ` council ]
by acting at % eu ] level we can guarantee a harmonised approach and create a level playing field for retailers and for the public
the common understanding agreed between the three institutions is a reflection of that interpretation
i do not need to recall the loss of life caused by indiscriminate attacks in recent years
i think we have struck the right balance between safety and security which was our primary concern without adding red tape for companies for farmers or for hotels with swimming pools which need to be cleaned with chemicals
transactions are reported and it is up to member states to define what kind of penalties will exist
mr president this is an unusual example of the % eu ] recognising a real problem which does need to be addressed internationally though not necessarily by the % eu ]
the problem with passing a law which prohibits people from purchasing something is that the longer the process takes the greater the chance of the purchasers in this case would be terrorists stockpiling the items in advance of the ban
i think it would have been preferable initially to agree internationally to enlist the support of the industry in adopting a voluntary code of practice and then to encourage all countries including member states to pass legislation without delay
mr president this report seeks to generate a regulation to restrict members of the public from purchasing and to require notification concerning sales of a large number of substances which are commonly used for legitimate purposes
the % uk ] does not need the % eu ] to tell it how to manage the availability of such substances
this is a regulation which seeks to extend the power and dominion of the % eu ] using the prevention of terrorism as a pretext
it will disrupt their plans to harm our societies this regulation represents a clear improvement in public security and will also simplify matters for suppliers by establishing a harmonised set of rules across * europe ]
the commission will continue to work in other areas too to help reduce the threat from terrorism
i will give you ! one ] example to explain what i mean and that is the work of the ` radicalisation awareness network ] which exchanges best practices between those who work on the ground with people at risk of being drawn into violent extremism
there are many others which show that we should take these matters very seriously and tackle them from different angles
i have to say that this is a very important % eu ] innovation
there are indeed new provisions in the regulation to make sure that interdependencies between social and safety aspects are adequately addressed by ` easa ]
this mechanism enhances the cooperative nature of the oversight system in * europe ]
i have taken good note of your comments
in the @ second part of the year ] we intend to issue reports on social issues in the aviation sector
let me also inform you that the commission will continue to work on this @ during the year ]
on the question of oversight let me say that the proposal includes a balanced and effective oversight support mechanism
i believe that we have a common understanding in considering this compromise as the right answer to the need to maintain a high level of civil aviation safety under the current challenges of growing traffic while ensuring the competitiveness of ) european ] aviation
~ first ] on social conditions this topic has not been forgotten during negotiations
the agency is already working on those issues including in urban areas through the socalled urban aviation space or u space as we normally call it
it is driven by a clear timeline and planning of the activities and reserves the possibility to take further measures to ensure safety if necessary
in the future ` easa ] will play a role in aviation security including cybersecurity and contribute upon request with its expertise to the implementation of rules in this area
this new mechanism will represent an important instrument for a high and uniform aviation safety in * europe ] let me finally mention that the commission has prepared a declaration concerning the global navigation satellite system as previously announced during the negotiations
this is in particular the case for the safe operation of drones with new provisions regarding registration of drones and drones operations
in practical terms we are changing the certification process to be more tuned in for innovation which means shortening time to market and keeping our industry more competitive this regulation closes the existing gap in the regulatory system and introduces effective cooperative safety management processes importantly it includes a system of pooling and sharing of resources between the member states and ` easa ] and establishes better governance for our aviation
allow me to underline other key benefits of the new regulation it takes into account new technologies and market developments to ensure that they are efficiently integrated into the aviation system as well as subject to effective and proportionate oversights
this will contribute to our common strategic objective of achieving a deeper and fairer internal market while fostering innovation with a strong positive impact on jobs and growth
this new regulation is also a centrepiece of the commission 's @ two thousand and fifteen ] aviation strategy for * europe ] ensuring safe secure and environmentally friendly aviation for % eu ] citizens
a safe and competitive ) european ] aviation industry needs an effective and balanced legislation such as the one which you will vote on tomorrow
agency
it does so through a better use of resources the enforcement of risk and performance based requirements and by eliminating unnecessary administrative burdens
i wish to thank again ` parliament ] and particularly mr } marinescu ] for the strong support on this important topic
another very important point for ` parliament ] was the establishment of an oversight support mechanism this objective has been achieved
this regulation also takes into account the interdependencies between aviation safety and aviation security
you can compromise on a lot of things but transparency is fundamental
why would you protect multinational corporations and not protect the small and mediumsized enterprises
then we can discuss tax levels and so on
we need to demand that companies report the full breakdown of their figures in each country not only in % eu ] states and countries on a future % eu ] tax blacklist which we know will be a very limited list
madam president public countrybycountry reporting is the single most important action that we can take to lift the veil on profit shifting by multinationals which results as we know in ( eur five hundred billion ] in tax being lost each year
the only people with anything to fear from tax transparency are tax cheats and their cheerleaders so why the question needs to be asked are you helping them
and make no mistake its purpose is to continue to allow profit shifting to tax havens to go unhindered
it should apply to those making more than ( eur forty million ]
it is appalling i have to say that conservative groups in this house have introduced a socalled safeguard clause on this global breakdown
it is good that this information is to be publicly disclosed but it needs to be done in a sensible way
this is a globalised economy that does not play by the same rules
there is much agreement across this ` parliament ] on the measures to be taken
in % ireland ] 's case the total take from corporation tax has doubled in @ the past three years ] now representing ! fifteen ] of the total tax take as against the ` oecd ] average of
we must not give other regions of the world an advantage over the % european union ]
accepting these proposals would establish an uneven playing field with % eu ] companies subject to more demanding requirements for public disclosure than their competitors from ~ third ] countries
with those considerations in mind we have worked hard to find a compromise that would be supported by all major political groups in ` parliament ]
the ` ppe group ] has supported the commission 's proposal from the very beginning
we have made important concessions
we do not want to discriminate against % eu ] companies and that is why we oppose some of the rapporteur 's amendments that simply put % eu ] companies at a competitive disadvantage visvis their ~ third ] country competitors and which would also make the business climate in the % european union ] less friendly for investors our objective is to strike a balance between the legitimate demand for more transparency on the one hand and the need to protect % eu ] companies in order to guarantee more jobs and growth in * europe ]
the left side of this house insisted on much more radical proposals that would go far beyond the commission 's draft and would undermine the ` oecd ] & beps agreement ]
and to put multinationals under pressure from public opinion to make sure that large companies pay their fair share of taxes in countries where they create value this is yet another piece of ) european ] legislation aimed at eliminating the harmful practices of tax avoidance and tax evasion in * europe ]
the commission also paid attention to complement but not undermine the existing system of exchange of a country by country reporting by tax authorities
~ first ] a growing public distrust in the fairness of the tax system and ~ second ] the accountability of multinational companies towards our citizens
mr } rosati ] do you not feel ashamed to invoke competitive disadvantage for multinationals when our citizens are demanding fairness in taxation and when we see that there has not been any fairness and indeed that multinationals have been abusing our
frankly i don 't understand your point
i think the whole thing here is about public disclosure of tax information not about avoiding taxes or tax avoidance
this tax avoidance is a task of tax authorities and we have to have trust in the national tax authorities that they do their job properly
the other thing is that we have to take into account the uneven playing field
if you put this requirement on % eu ] companies and other companies ) american ] ) canadians ] ) japanese ] don 't have the same obligation that would be harmful for our businesses
but it raises more questions than it answers
what for example does it tell us about the commission 's future intentions
we know the commission wants big companies to supply it with information on their % eu ] and non % eu ] operations for publication in an % eu ] register
the list is modest in length although no doubt it will cost companies a great deal of time and money to prepare the figures and also to have them audited as the proposal requires
when the commission asks companies not just about tax they pay in different member states but also to disclose the nature of activities in ~ third ] countries the number of employees in each location the related net turnover and accumulated earnings we can deduce that the % eu ] aims to not only harmonise
corporation taxes but also to introduce taxes based on wealth capital and turnover rather than profits and to challenge existing tax residency and transfer pricing rules
when multinational corporations realise this some of them will ask themselves why they should bother investing time effort and capital in the % eu ] rather than somewhere else
some will rightly conclude that markets are growing much faster elsewhere in the world and that bigger profits can be made without endangering themselves to the avarice of an % eu ] commission running out of other people 's money which is shortly about to have a budget crisis when its ~ second ] largest net contributor the % united kingdom ] leaves
there are only so many eggs you can get out of a golden ` google ]
with country by country reporting public authorities will have all the opportunities to fight tax fraud and tax evasion
because in reality what is happening is that we are supporting international agreements in the framework of ` oecd ] and the proposal of the commission
but our socialist friends are undermining these international agreements come on tell us why are you undermining the international cooperation that is needed in order to fight tax fraud
and how will it look in the future when the % european union ] is not sticking to the international agreements and when other partners are saying it is not ideal to have agreements with you
that is political fraud to undermine the international cooperation for fighting tax fraud and you should be ashamed or vote for us @ tomorrow ]
i think that is something we have to be careful about
& vnuk ] is the law until it is changed my country % ireland ] along with other member states has not changed domestic law as it is required to do if this issue is not challenged
in the meantime citizens all over % europe ] who use motor vehicles on private land will have no clarity about whether they require ~ third ] party liability cover for their vehicles
the commission has itself acknowledged on several occasions that the ruling adopted by the ` ecj ] is a problem and that it requires a quick solution but the commission has tiptoed around providing a solution
we now have a legal limbo which must be addressed quickly by the commission otherwise it will have dramatic consequences for farmers the construction industry and indeed motor sports enthusiasts who will pay a hugely unfair price for a hugely unfair ruling
likewise insurance companies will take advantage of the } vnuk ] ruling
the fact that @ today ] we do not have an efficient tool to solve the problem cannot be an excuse for not taking a position on an issue which is so important for more than ! three hundred ] ! zero ] non citizens living in the * baltic states ]
this is not true
i would like to counter disinformation that is spreading in this house
the & estonian constitution ] was adopted @ twelve years ] before we joined the % european union ]
the problem is the same voting rights of so called aliens
therefore across * europe ] privatisation of key public services has to be reconsidered
this reminds me not just of the # enron crisis ] but also of the last financial crisis an example of where profits were privatised and the losses nationalised
over the @ last sixteen years ] the company continued to pay increases to its shareholders
for now we must prioritise securing the jobs and pensions of the ` carillion ] workers affected in my constituency and elsewhere
madam president i would like to call this house 's attention to the ) british ] government 's terrible handling of the # carillion crisis ] ` carillion ] one of the ) uk ] government 's biggest private contractors based in my constituency has collapsed today threatening the jobs and pensions of more than ! forty three ] ! zero ] employees despite ! three ] warnings last year the government still decided to award ! two billion ] of new contracts to this
madam president the * schengen area ] is the embodiment of the principle of freedom of movement in the % european union ]
around a ! million ] % united kingdom ] citizens live outside of the % uk ] mostly in that area
these are people who have chosen to make their lives in the % european union ] and it is a life choice that is about a great deal more than work
these ) uk ] citizens have been badly let down by the lame agreement that the % united kingdom ] government has negotiated for their futures
ironically these are the ) uk ] citizens most likely to be young least likely to have the @ five years ] residential qualification and most likely to identify themselves as ) european ]
madam president journalism is a cornerstone of democracy holding those in power to account the appointment of editor in chief of independent news media stephen rae to the eu expert group on fake news beggars belief
mr } rae ] talks of the widespread damage done by the wilful dissemination of false information and social media platforms
what about the damage done by mr } rae ] 's sacking of a journalist for trying to uncover the quashing of penalty points for influential people including possibly himself or the damage done by his newspaper when its reporting aided a vicious fake news smear campaign against a ` garda ] whistleblower or how about the damage done to another journalist who is hampered from writing about the now commissioner } phil hogan ]
and more still is the damage done to democracy by his paymaster } denis o 'brien ] who is reported as having a chilling effect on news gathering and reporting in the public interest
it is behaviour like this that damages trust in mainstream media and aids the spread of fake news
there has been a ruling in the arbitration court so what are we debating here
i ~ first ] of all want to congratulate the rapporteur on the presentation of her report on financial assistance for energy projects i strongly welcome this initiative which provides for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects the financing of projects in this area will help to stimulate economic recovery in * europe ] and indeed in my own country % ireland ] and help to create new employment opportunities and also help in the fight against climate change
madam president @ last december ] the ) portuguese ] attorney general closed the case on the purchase of submarines from a ) german ] consortium after @ nine years ] of investigation based on strong suspicions of corruption fraud and money laundering
this will be a high priority for the presidency as we wish to respect the deadline set by the ` european council ] calling for a review and update of the internal security strategy by @ mid two thousand and fifteen ] in @ december last year ] the ` council ] adopted conclusions
it also provides for a reinforced system of extended powers of confiscation or confiscation from a ~ third ] party
the new directive on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime adopted by the ` european parliament ] and ` council ] in @ two thousand and fourteen ] provides broader opportunities for confiscating the proceeds of crime in cases where a conviction cannot be delivered because the person concerned has absconded from justice or has fallen ill
! one ] of these key principles is that the renewed internal security strategy should identify the main common threats and challenges
criminal groups can amass huge profits from the various criminal activities and markets and it is generally agreed that disrupting and recovering the financial flows of a criminal group is an efficient way to stop crime
@ two thousand and fifteen ] the ` council ] attaches great importance to the % eu ] anti corruption report which was issued for the first time by the commission on @ three february ]
we believe it will provide further incentives for the member states to ratify and effectively implement the existing anti corruption instruments
the ` council ] is looking forward to the commission 's initiatives in this respect
nonetheless during the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the instrument the ` council ] and ` parliament ] felt that still more could be done in this field
! six hundred ] organised crime groups were active in the % european union ] criminal organisations are becoming increasingly flexible and are diversifying their activities
@ two thousand and ten ] this cycle ensures an operational response to organised and serious international crime through optimised coordination and cooperation between national law enforcement authorities % eu ] institutions agencies and other relevant partners
the ` council ] has been continuously engaged in a range of initiatives targeting organised crime and corruption and has been treating them as a matter of the highest political priority
it is our obligation to guarantee our citizens a general area of justice freedom and security by preventing and combating serious and organised crime as well as corruption
as a result criminal groups are increasingly capable of influencing the operation of the legal markets and even the institutional and political processes across the % eu ] by engaging in corrupt practices
links are steadily growing with a broad range of other lucrative criminal activities such as drugs or even trafficking in human beings or exploiting technological developments for criminal purposes huge criminal proceeds are generated
we have to mobilise all our instruments to this end and combine efforts to adopt a comprehensive and coherent approach to crime ` europol ] 's serious and organised crime threat assessment estimated in @ two thousand and thirteen ] that ! three ]
to that end they adopted together with the directive ! two ] declarations calling upon the commission to consider the possibility of submitting further proposals on this matter
such crimes will be closely monitored by ` europol ] which is expected to submit to the ` council ] an interim serious and organised crime threat assessment at the @ end of march ]
for @ the coming years ] in the field of internal security the ` council ] considers that serious and organised crime in all its forms constitutes ! one ] of these threats
within this framework the ` council ] agreed to a series of operational actions targeting among other things counterfeiting and cybercrime which were agreed as % eu ] crime priorities emerging crimes like wildlife trafficking illegal waste trafficking or trafficking in cultural goods
the role of asset recovery has been acknowledged as an integral part of the fight against serious and organised cross border crime
which set out the ` council ] 's considerations on the general structure and some key principles of the renewed % eu ] internal security strategy
this instrument is a clear step forward in ensuring that criminals can no longer have access to assets derived from certain types of criminal activity and this contributes to strengthening the response to serious forms of crime
@ last year ] 's ~ first ] anti corruption report shows that the nature and extent of corruption varied from ! one ] member state to another and that corruption affects all member states
! four ] out of ! ten ] ) european ] companies consider corruption to be an obstacle for doing business in the internal market
the directive adopted @ last year ] on the freezing and confiscation of assets is a significant step forward
lastly the recent agreement on the ~ fourth ] & anti money laundering directive ] is promising in terms of enabling financial investigations to identify criminal beneficial owners of companies more easily
an % eu ] strategy to fight the illicit trafficking of weapons was adopted
the current operational priorities of ` europol ] include illegal immigration human trafficking counterfeit goods excise fraud synthetic drugs cocaine and heroin cybercrime
funding is provided through parts of the internal security fund roughly ( eur one billion ] over the period @ two thousand and fourteen ] @ two thousand and twenty ] i will mention firearms trafficking as it echoes @ last week ] 's tragic events and was identified by ` europol ]
the commission is ready to work with the member states to ensure that the existing legislation on ~ firstly ] cyber attacks ~ secondly ] payment fraud and ~ thirdly ] child sexual abuse online is correctly and swiftly implemented
with eastern partners the focus is on corruption
we will consider this request in full dialogue with the other ) european ] institutions the commission as you know has just taken measures to increase its own transparency which is essential for preventing corruption
the commission has actively engaged with ~ third ] countries and relevant international organisations for instance we have a full agenda with the % united states ] as regards the fight against cybercrime and child sexual abuse
firearms and organised property crime
in our eurobarometer survey in @ two thousand and thirteen ] more than ! half ] of ) europeans ] said corruption in their country had increased over @ the previous three years ]
the commission is committed to enabling closer public private cooperation in fighting cybercrime
combating the infiltration of organised crime into the legal economy will contribute to economic recovery and growth
preventing corruption and promoting integrity has rightfully moved up the ) european ] agenda in the @ past decade ]
the & two thousand and eight framework decision ] on the fight against organised crime on which the commission will issue an implementation report @ this year ]
the resolution on renewing the internal security strategy which this ` parliament ] adopted on @ three december two thousand and fourteen ] rightly puts this fight among the few priorities on which we should continue to focus our joint efforts in the @ years ahead ]
in @ two thousand and thirteen ] the commission is now evaluating the possibility of proposing the approximation of some criminal offences related to weapons and to strengthening the checks for some categories of firearms
the report identified areas in need of further attention
the % european union ] has responded with the creation of the ` european cybercrime centre ] within ` europol ] and the & cyber attacks directive ] which member states should implement by @ september ]
prevention should be a strong component of the fight against organised crime
of the framework decision
offences relating to participation in a criminal organisation
the commission also decided to engage ~ third ] countries and relevant international organisations
madam president ! one ] of the most profitable and despicable organised crimes is the trafficking of human beings the buying selling and abusing of vulnerable people with little more respect than that offered to a sack of potatoes
victims of trafficking are still being prosecuted for crimes that they have been forced to commit rather than being treated as victims and this adds to their injustice
we have very welcome developments such as the & anti trafficking directive ] and a most effective and committed anti trafficking coordinator but there is still much to do to protect these vulnerable people
cross border policing joint investigative teams and the work of ` europol ] are all essential but not enough
i would also like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to intervene on this very important topic
the % eu ] policy cycle has provided us with a strong methodology to combat crime in a more coordinated way making the best use of our resources
we firmly believe that the renewed internal security strategy will represent another step forward in developing a % union ] that protects the rights and freedoms of our citizens we should make continuous efforts to strengthen the framework by providing for more comprehensive responses to the challenges
posed by organised crime and corruption
we want passengers to be taken home or to where they want to
let me mention in particular delay on short and medium distances
in practice air passengers are not always afforded the rights to which they are entitled
~ second ] right of information
this is ~ firstly ] because the enforcement system which is now in place is not sufficiently effective and is not applied uniformly across the % eu ] ~ secondly ] if airlines and passengers have different interpretations of the same text disputes become unavoidable
~ first ] enforcement
delay there might be a financial incentive for it to cancel delayed flights
i am speaking now to address potential problems at $ gibraltar airport ]
this has resulted in massive and unacceptable delays
the context is that the government of % spain ] systematically and as i see it vindictively inflicts petty controls at the land border between % gibraltar ] and % spain ]
attempts have been made and are being made by members of this ` parliament ] by means of legislative devices to suffocate air travel in and out of % gibraltar ] 's airport
this is a disgrace and i urge colleagues to support the amendments @ today ]
these include reducing the trigger points from ! five ] to ! three ] which may seem to benefit the consumer but perhaps could see many more air cancellations and that would be regrettable as a consequence this could lead to a reduction in feeder flights from regional airports which in turn could destroy some of the long standing inter line agreements a practice which has
however we fought hard in this ` parliament ] to raise the profile of and support our regional airports which benefit local communities generate economic growth and create jobs throughout the supply chain and there are parts of this report which if adopted we have concerns about
but regrettably we are in a position where some of the areas have been changed from the commission proposal which could lead to some unintended consequences for passengers by i believe possibly reducing choice putting up prices and damaging the competitiveness of our regional carriers
it was in the original regulation i asked for it to be removed and that was not the case
it was raised as an issue last year at the ` transport council ]
after the & cordoba agreement ] in @ two thousand and six ] % spain ] told the commission that it would no longer seek % gibraltar ] 's exclusion from such aviation measures indeed it recently transposed into national law an open skies agreement with post # cordoba ] language
but the commission 's proposed revision of the regulation left in the % gibraltar ] exclusion clause
that must come out
it has been raised here in our ` transport committee ] by me and others and in both ` parliament ] and the ` council ] people have asked why we are debating a sovereignty dispute when we should be debating passengers rights
mr president i would ~ firstly ] like to congratulate our rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent report and also the commission for actually addressing this issue it would however be useful at this point to ask why this revision of & regulation no two hundred and sixty one two thousand and four ] is necessary it is necessary because the present regulation is being abused by airlines and they are being assisted in that abuse by national regulators who have completely abdicated their responsibilities and encouraged through non action the airlines to drive a coach and horses through this legislation
the compensation offered to the passengers on that flight was a big fat ! zero ]
because the airlines claim that every delay or cancellation is due to force majeure or extraordinary circumstances and if you challenge that view you are told we will see you in court
this report will severely restrict this loophole by making clear that technical problems are not force majeure
i say to this parliament @ today ] and to the aviation industry out there that this regulation and report is about passenger rights not airline rights and should be supported by the whole house finally can i thank ` monarch airlines ] for showing me in practical terms why this regulation had to be amended and the loopholes closed after a dreadful experience coming back a mere @ twenty six hours ] late from % tenerife ] in @ august two thousand and twelve ]
this report will put an end to this type of happy time that the airlines have enjoyed up to now
a compromise of > three hours ] was and that also mirrors the ` european court of justice ] 's position of > three hours ] as the trigger
so this is considerably better than the starting point of the commission which was > five hours ] we are also able to support the narrowing of the extraordinary circumstances to stop airlines hiding behind this excuse to avoid
i would like to thank the rapporteur for his very constructive approach and i am very pleased to say that we have been able to change the emphasis in the commission proposal from one which was largely pro industry pro airline to one which is much more pro passenger and that is the version we will vote on @ today ] although my group 's view that compensation should be paid after > one hour ] was not carried
this is a good thing especially for an island nation like % ireland ] which depends a lot on aviation
since the entry into force of the regulation in @ two thousand and four ] there have been problems in relation to the variation in interpretations resulting from grey areas and gaps in the current @ two thousand and four ] regulation
this should help smaller airports in particular to continue to grow and develop
this ` parliament ] has already expressed its opinions on several occasions about the above points in the context of its resolutions adopted in
but it does need regulation and a regulation fit for purpose we all know of a number of unfair practices and reductions in the quality of services with negative consequences for travellers
passengers have difficulty first of all in enforcing their rights when air carriers are in breach of the legislation and on many occasions passengers are not even aware of their rights as airlines are not providing the information needed
the commission stupidly and predictably gave the ) spanish ] government about @ six weeks ] notice so for the purpose of that ! one ] visit the ) spanish ] authorities for want of a better word cleaned up their act the reality is that these delays are still going on and you and your colleague should be heartily ashamed of yourselves
too often airlines fail to offer passengers the assistance that current % eu ] legislation binds them to exploiting the gaps in enforcement by national enforcement bodies and exploiting passengers lack of knowledge of their rights over issues of legal interpretation
therefore i welcome this debate on how best to protect them
to generate economic growth we must encourage business entrepreneurship and increased tourism
an important part of doing this is by ensuring that our workforce feels confident and indeed that foreign visitors feel confident to travel by air
this report would give better protection by ensuring that passengers subject to long delays receive the same rights to compensation as those suffering cancellations it would also extend the right to accommodation in these cases and emphasise support for disabled passengers
passengers also stand to be better supported in situations where carriers go out of business
this is positive
we must however recognise the opportunities that our air industry and new air routes bring for jobs and growth in regional economies
it is vital that while passengers are protected airlines are not placed under enormous financial pressures with legislation
for far too long some and i stress some airlines have obfuscated obstructed and obscured the rights of air passengers to proper compensation when they suffer serious delays to their journeys
with the revision to this regulation and a new comprehensive list of extraordinary circumstances we can close the loopholes which have prevented passengers including many of my constituents from receiving restitution when delayed by airlines for reasons of poor operational management in future passengers will also have clear and transparent information on hand luggage allowances and reassurance that they will not be penalised
but despite so many enhancements to passenger rights there is ! one ] glaring reversal % gibraltar ]
the current law has not been one of the easiest to implement particularly concerning extraordinary circumstances
the ` civil aviation authority ] in the % uk ] for instance is really struggling with this term our clarifications really do help in this respect
i am hopeful for the success of my amendment suggesting a tax free ticket for a carer required to accompany a person with disabilities
i would not support new amendments that take things ! one ] step too far as the unintended consequences would be more cancellations fewer regional flights fewer through tickets and increased prices for passengers
the problem here is there is simply no justification for excluding ) gibraltarian ] citizens citizens of the % eu ] from passenger rights that will apply to everybody else
it is absolute discrimination and an absolute undermining of their fundamental rights as ) european ] citizens
it seems very odd to me that members of the ` transport committee ] did not take the opportunity offered by my colleague mrs } foster ] in her amendments and vote to end this discrimination proposed by the commission
i want to add my voice to those @ today ] who have been objecting to this gross discrimination
mr president paragraph ! thirteen ] is completely covered by part of paragraph ! nine ] and to remove the repetition i would like to propose an oral amendment to delete paragraph
mr president i would just like to take this opportunity to say something about the importance of forestry and the importance of trees the importance of wood there are ! three ] main reasons for this importance ~ first ] tackling climate change
and ~ thirdly ] we can improve people 's health by getting them out exercising in forests so tackling climate change creating jobs and improving health all show why man 's best friend is not the dog man 's best friend is the tree
~ second ] creating jobs
on the ~ first ] of these tackling climate change we already sequestrate absorb ! ten ] of our carbon emissions at the % eu ] level through our forest cover
~ secondly ] we can create a large number of new jobs in this area in my own constituency of the north east there is big job potential
through these policies the % eu ] also makes a very important contribution to the implementation of sustainable forest management and member states decisions related to forestry and the entire forest based sector as well as forest protection
therefore the forest strategy aims to ensure that such an important natural resource for our economy and society will continue to deliver its economic benefits in spite of new challenges such as climate change and related threats
it takes an integrated approach covering internal and external forest policy issues and addresses the whole forest value chain considering the important contribution that the sector can make to growth and jobs in the % eu ] and as i said particularly in rural areas therefore in accordance with the ` council ] conclusions on the forest strategy the commission in cooperation with the member states and stakeholders is developing a multiannual implementation plan of the & eu forest strategy ] which will contain the specific actions to be carried out by the commission and the member states with clearly defined outputs and a timetable for implementation stakeholders will also be fully involved in this implementation this will also increase the synergy between the work done by different commission services for the implementation of the strategy and it would facilitate stocktaking so the timing of the initiative is very good and the commission will carefully consider this ` parliament ] report in the preparation of the multiannual implementation plan of the & eu forest strategy ]
when you look at the strategy itself the basic aim is to establish a framework for forest based actions and support for sustainable forest management based on the coordination of the different forest policies in member states and of % eu ] policies and initiatives relative to forestry and related forest based sector activities
for example the strategy addresses the issue of growth and jobs not only in forestry but across the forest based sector
the strategy provides a holistic approach to forest management it covers the economic social and environmental benefits of forests
but this is not all the strategy also relates to climate change as it contributes largely to both climate mitigation and climate adaptation
we have common values objectives and common concerns regarding ) european ] forests and their future
several % eu ] policies have an impact on forests including rural development climate change industry environment bio energy and the broader bio economy
from a political perspective too i would like to underline that the new forest strategy is very much in line with the political guidelines of the ` juncker commission ]
mr president i would like to thank ms } kstinger ] very much for her report i believe that much sustainable forest management is currently being constrained by wellmeaning but overly prescriptive and bureaucratic environmental legislation and that includes things like the & eu timber regulation ]
so i welcome the report 's emphasis on the upcoming review of that regulation and a call for a new regulation that reduces unnecessary costs and reporting requirements for * europe ] 's foresters
i do understand the need to apply the regulation to ~ third ] country imports but a blanket approach in the % eu ] is not necessary
families and friends are grieving for the victims of this latest disaster and % greece ] really is ! one ] of the hotspots of the effect of climate change that we see all over * europe ]
the commissioner has already outlined some of those issues
i think we should also engage in the long term to help rebuild apart from the lives that were lost we also have severe damage to infrastructure and housing
all those prevention measures will become more and more important as we see climate change progressing
so we need to get smart
we need to make sure that people are not harmed that no damage is done by the catastrophe we need to focus on prevention so that we don 't have to be sorry for loss later on
their attacks do not command political support from the people of % northern ireland ]
i wish i could say that they will not succeed but sadly in % northern ireland ] it seems that violence does pay so much so that @ today ] we have ! three ] convicted ` ira ] terrorists as government ministers and our joint first minister } mcguinness ]
he is no better than or different to the % antrim ] terrorists who stood over the dying soldiers and pumped more bullets into their bodies
it is appreciated in % northern ireland ] that you should at this time think of those who mourn in that regard
mr president thank you for your words of condolence on behalf of our ) british ] soldiers who lost their lives on > saturday evening ]
those who murdered the ! two ] soldiers seek political advance through the path of violence
is someone who } peter robinson ] at a time when he opposed terrorists in government said had personally murdered at least ! twelve ] soldiers
mr president on > saturday night ] in % northern ireland ] we were all i think like everyone very shocked ! two ] young soldiers brutally murdered in cold blood
but i have to say this they can never succeed they cannot win because it is the democratic process in % northern ireland ] that has spoken and that must win
our thoughts can only go out to them @ today ] as they were cut down in the prime of life
let me first start with the question of whether * europe ] acted quickly
we were the ~ first ] to bring financial support and to send our own staff our own doctors are there risking their lives to mobilise attention to this epidemic
the answer is no and this is why we have to make every effort possible to fight ebola at origin now and do it in the most aggressive way we
at the moment there is very aggressive deployment of all that has been developed in terms of vaccines and treatment so that we can provide help to people who are infected
i want to praise our member states because in @ the last weeks ] we have seen a surge in reaction from them just to give you some examples % austria ] with protective equipment % italy ] with a field hospital
i could not agree more that coordination saves lives
fight the bigger the risk of this virus mutating
well it is through the handling of infected chimpanzees gorillas monkeys porcupines but at the moment we are not seeing it as a danger for the rest of the world because we are not seeing that kind of movement of products also
us and also a very direct question is the opening up of travel a risk for * europe ]
but let us be very fair and straight on that quantities are limited
so can we help everybody who needs help @ today ]
we have to act in a coordinated manner already in @ august ] together with the ` world health organisation ] we approached our member states by activating the & civil protection mechanism ] asking for
very often we in the humanitarian community are like the canary in the mine we feel trouble and we sense danger before the rest of the world understands the magnitude of this danger
on the epidemic itself it is unprecedented in ! two ] ways
mr president we have heard a very comprehensive presentation from the ` council ]
we are talking about an impact on their economies and their societies that is quite dramatic
~ secondly ] at no time before has an ebola epidemic lasted so long and it is not yet contained so we are in a very unusual and very dramatic situation
we are not talking anymore just about a health emergency in the ! three ] countries
of course we are mobilising money
we are very constrained in terms of personnel equipment and transport
~ secondly ] we may not be able to protect other countries in the region from the spread of the epidemic
it is not only * eu twenty eight ] but it is a very significant part for the % uk ] and i think we should support our science and research community and get the money out to where it can make a difference
in answer to the ~ second ] question about ) italian ] researchers again i cannot speak for ) italian ] researchers
the % uk ] research community is one of the leaders in trying to solve and help find solutions for infectious diseases that unless cured at source are putting increased risks back on our own communities at home for example drug resistant tb which is back in parts of * europe ]
no one can find cures to ebola by themselves but this programme enables ) african ] partners to work with our own national researchers both charitably funded researchers and private companies like ` glaxo smith kline ] which i understand may have the most advanced potential vaccine for ebola
let us put it to good use and get it to the scientists right now
i understand that the commission is looking to fast track some of this money into researching anti viral drugs and vaccines for ebola and i hope that colleagues will support this
how do we make sure that this time we do the research and continue it when the headlines disappear when hopefully we get the disease under control
we have to get the emergency under control but once that is done we need to reflect on the long term
why have more people died in this epidemic than have died since the disease was first identified about @ forty years ago ]
they have gone in under very difficult conditions
why is it that vaccines and treatments have been looked at for @ many years ] but we have not had the results we need
as the commissioner said we need to strengthen the health systems in those countries and if we make that commitment to strengthen them it is a good investment for ) european ] citizens because ultimately it will protect us at home as well
it is pretty clear that we have all been slow off the mark and we need to be asking ourselves why is it that this epidemic is far more serious than ever before
we need to prevent future outbreaks
we must boost efforts to develop treatments for ebola and other deadly diseases too often these diseases are ignored by pharmaceutical companies
they cannot make money from them
that is why we must invest public money
@ today ] they have launched human clinical trials
this was only possible because they have the expertise through % eu ] supported research
funding for this kind of research is vital
global epidemics need to be contained quickly we can only learn to do that through research
mr president as we have watched this horrifying disease unfold and the problems get worse and worse i think we can all unite in saying how awful the situation is and how we salute the health workers who are there i think it is absolutely crucial that at this time the politicians give direct answers are honest straightforward and take effective measures and that all of us get behind the people who are trying to deal with this terrible problem
i think that more than anything we should all be united in sending our prayers our best wishes and all our hopes to those who are suffering from this awful thing at this terrible time and all our hopes are with them that they can come through this
i think we need to do that we need to contain the problem and get the % european ] and ` african unions ] involved in that containment programme
i also want to ask the commissioner if there is a vaccine or if there is something going on in the % united states ]
there are also suggestions that % eu ] funding in the future will be contingent upon national acceptance of the ` european public prosecutor 's office ] and that non * eurozone ] members will have to adopt the single currency
it has announced its intention to speed up the capital markets union it has increased the size of the juncker fund by a staggering ( eur one hundred and eighty five billion ] and announced the formation of a common defence fund
i would suggest and ask the % eu ] to very very seriously consider whether some of the announcements that they have made and the demands that are now being placed on member states will actually be counterproductive to what they want to do in terms of stopping populism
on terrorism we also urgently need answers but i do not think that your recipe of simply collecting more and more data is going to do it
and yes of course we need to prosecute those who pose a real threat to us and our way of life absolutely but we also need to look further into the root causes of radicalisation so that fewer people become a threat to our security and to our freedom
but rather than doing that and wasting a lot of money we should make pooling and sharing the rule and not the exception
i think it is super disappointing that the ` council ] has dropped any progress on the issue of solidarity from the agenda and i am afraid that if you cannot even solve that task then i really have a hard time imagining how there can be progress in other areas at least not in a way that will be satisfactory i think the reason for that is that
we need to strengthen the exchange of data on actual suspects and unknown risk persons so that the tools that we already have today actually serve the security of our citizens
your answer to conflicts and violence worldwide is just to push for more military spending
for solving problems you would actually need to tackle their root causes you would have to look at the root cause for why people have to flee and do something about that
but i do not really think that that particular industry really needs that extra bit of help but what we are actually doing here or what we would be doing here is actually to make a ~ twenty ninth ] or ~ twenty eighth ] sort of defence policy
this sort of cooperation could actually save us something like ( eur one hundred billion ] every year money that is actually urgently needed to tackle all the root causes of conflicts for example in the world
i wish the presidency good luck with their discussions and i hope that it will defy my low expectations and actually dare to look into the root causes and come up with solutions that actually solve something
we need to make sure that the upcoming pillar of social rights will prepare the labour market in * europe ] to provide better jobs particularly for young people and we need to make sure that our * eurozone ] will start working for real convergence
there is a lot of hard work to be done
we also need to be prepared to open a new generation of trade agreements pushing for sustainable development all over the world
worldwide starting with * africa ]
at the same time we also need to build much more powerful instruments to cope with citizens concerns
we have just now the revision of the european fund for strategic investments and we need to make sure that this fund will become more powerful pushing for real additional strategic investment projects
so the defence package just presented by the commission is certainly a very important move and we need to be prepared to have that discussion about the package but we know that lasting peace also depends a lot on permanent systemic action for development
} theresa may ] gambled and she lost and the country is deeply divided
it is now time to act
we have to protect our borders
now we can go a step further
but the % uk ] government expects to begin negotiations @ later this month ] for we have kept you waiting long enough
because while the deal with % turkey ] appears to be holding for now the ` council ] must seek consensus from all member states to effectively tackle the migrant crisis in case that agreement breaks down by getting the basics right processing asylum applications quickly and efficiently returning those who do not qualify to their country of origin agreeing clear criteria for qualification based on the & geneva convention ]
we may be divided on our politics but we are united in not wanting to allow the terrorists to win
our discussions on the challenges will continue way beyond this summit and future ones but how many times do we have to discuss them before our voters see real progress
at the international level military cooperation without undermining ` nato ] better data sharing between national law enforcement agencies
while others will call for more agencies the ` ecr group ] calls for more action and while others will call for further political integration the ` ecr group ] calls for political cooperation for a reformed % eu ] which does less but does it better
now if that means addressing concerns over civil liberties while drafting new laws to tackle the threat of terrorism to my mind a wider coalition is not necessarily a bad thing
topics we have discussed before and no doubt topics that we will discuss again
while others will call for new rules the ` ecr group ] calls for the % eu ] to make what we already have work better
can i also take this opportunity to thank colleagues from across the political spectrum for their messages of condolences and solidarity after the recent terrorist attacks in both % manchester ] and my home city of % london ]
and by not continuing to pursue a struggling relocation scheme without the full support of all member states
i hope the ` council ] will understand the importance of tackling terrorism at different levels
but security is just one of the issues facing us the migration crisis continues as does the % eu ] % turkey ] deal and the ` ecr ] believes that the % eu ] should focus on a new relationship based not on the false promise of membership but on an honest relationship based on cooperation
an election in which the ` conservative party ] lost seats but not enough to lose power and where the opposition gained seats but not enough to gain power and ended up ! fifty six ] seats behind and just as in any other country for example the % netherlands ] at the moment the largest party will seek to form a government with support from a smaller party
but each time we have to ask ourselves are we any closer to solutions and real action
there is now a big push a big drive for us to opt for a % norway ] style option and i have to confess that your chief negotiator mr } barnier ] is right it took } theresa may ] @ nine months ] to trigger & article fifty ] and by the time the talks start it will be nearly @ four months ] since it was triggered so i do accept that we go into this as a ) british ] government with a ) british ] prime minister in a very weak position and she is caught in a bit of a pincer movement because the political class
but that has not stopped a parade of former prime ministers and of former ) european ] commissioners from lining up and attempting to get the ) british ] government to backslide on its commitments
would like us to stay in the customs union and to stay in the single market but the people have made it perfectly clear they want us to leave both of those things
in fact on the > morning ] of the # general election ] ! seventy ] of the ) british ] public whichever way they had voted in the referendum simply wanted the government to get on and complete and conclude # brexit ]
but there are ! five ] pressing questions that need to be answered on a shortterm basis
what is the proposal so that the & good friday agreement ] can be kept in place and that no hard border will be created between the % republic ] on the one hand and % northern ireland ] on the other hand
i am very grateful to the commission for the different reflection papers that they have put on the table but the commission is more than a think tank
we always say do not waste a good crisis
so i think the time is now right for us to receive from the ) british ] side clear answers to these ! five ] questions so that these negotiations can start
because of the uncertainty that has been created
the ~ second ] question is will it be the opinion of the ) tories ] or the position of the whole nation party interest or national interest
i think the moment is now there when we start these # brexit ] talks to have also legislative proposals on the reform of the % european union ] on defence as you have done and on economic and monetary union
that is the moment to go forward
but then > six hours ] later there is no deal and they are still discussing it
negotiations furthermore in the light of recent developments the ` european council ] will return to trade policy leaders are expected to reaffirm the % eu ] strong commitment to our trade policy they will also discuss how the % eu ] can make sure trade remains free and fair for all to conclude i would like to mention two other important topics ~ first ] leaders will show their strong and continued support to the & paris agreement ] on climate change this is an important point and we will discuss this here later on in the morning and i think that we should expect some strong language
mr president at @ next week ] 's # council ] there will be a new ) irish ] face around the table and a new face of % ireland ] perhaps
@ today ] the taoiseach } enda kenny ] hands over that office to } leo varadkar ] and i take this opportunity to wish our new taoiseach our new party leader well in his work ahead and also to acknowledge the great work of } enda kenny ] as leader of our country in very difficult times
@ yesterday ] there were tributes paid to him and the most remarkable comments were the simplest and nicest ones about his sunny disposition his optimism in dark times and how that is so needed in politics today
he spoke about the honour that he had of leading our country and i hope that our new leader will carry that same optimistic disposition and work for a united * europe ]
his last call was to } theresa may ] to warn her about a # brexit ] that would damage the & good friday agreement ]
we should honour his words his commitment to peace and his commitment to * europe ]
i salute his work and i wish our new leader every success
let me use these concluding remarks to make a more general comment
recently a tangible sense of unity urgency and responsibility has been added to our actions
this should also encourage us ` parliament ] and the ` council ] to deliver results more rapidly united by the same objective and showing that we are able to meet the challenges that the % eu ] is facing
the presidency needs your ideas and your energy
it needs your flexibility and your sense of responsibility to deliver on the guidance provided by the ` european council ]
we have had many achievements in the @ past five months ] but there is much more work to be done ahead of us
political elitism is a doctrine of servitude but its forces are strong determined and well financed and it is attacking and destroying its enemies ! one ] by ! one ]
they attacked and removed the voices of resistance from our radio and tv stations they attack and abuse the president who was elected in the % united states of america ] yet celebrate the globalist placeman they installed in % france ]
those who love freedom patriots ) democrats ] ) brexiteers ] must say no more we must regroup and return fire
yes it is public public but that has a spillover effect as we say that it has to be close to the market
these if successful will have significant implications on the living conditions in that region in those countries concerned
it took us @ five years ] to arrive at the day where we are @ today ] where we have a programme which in my opinion is pretty significant in that area a programme that should lead to integration of capacities our capabilities and abilities
i am a little bit concerned that it was quite difficult to negotiate the budget for this programme it is as if we always have a difference between the ambition and the understanding that we need the means to tackle the issues at the roots but then when we have a programme which has a solid basis we have the difficulties to allocate the necessary financial means but i think that the outcome is a positive one it is something that we can build on
how do we solve these issues
without food and water we cannot make it
so prima will fill this critical gap
these challenges are border blind and are often too big to be addressed by a single country
the * mediterranean ] is a destiny
ladies and gentlemen i am personally invested in seeing this unique initiative succeed
water shortages have a negative impact on crop yields so access also means the health and well being of the population
water availability and thus agricultural production is of strategic importance for the whole * mediterranean sea ]
it is an issue because it is the biggest issue that we have in front of us as people as human beings
prima will seek to ensure ! two ] of people 's most basic needs today food and water
our modern concept of * northern and southern mediterranean ] is an artificial distinction proximity to this sea creates a shared heritage and with that comes shared challenges and science and innovation must be the tools to tackle those challenges ` prima ] is recognisably the greatest achievement to date in euro med collaboration in research and innovation
@ today ] during this debate we need to keep in mind ! three ] things about ` prima ] the what the why and the how
this cooperation would not have been possible without the personal commitment of ms } sakorafa ] and the tireless efforts of the ) maltese ] presidency and the hard work of the negotiation teams are a testament of this cooperation
so i want to seize this opportunity as ms } sakorafa ] just did to thank the ` european parliament ] and in particular the rapporteur ms } sofia sakorafa ] but also everyone involved in this work and this amazing team that put all the institutions working together
it is also an excellent example of successful cooperation between the ) european ] institutions
~ first ] the what
why is this an issue for us
we have to acknowledge that these issues are the root causes of migration both within and beyond borders
it means the livelihoods of rural and urban populations and it means territorial development
it will bundle know how and resources to encourage long term research and innovation cooperation between the * mediterranean ] countries from the north to the south
i count on you honourable members of ` parliament ] to seize this historic opportunity and to help shape the future of the * mediterranean basin ] by adopting the & prima ] initiative in @ tomorrow ] 's vote
but we have to put in the means we have to put in the resources
so no effort can be spared to identify novel approaches to ensure water availability right now there is an insufficient level of research and innovation and investment in the region this means a lack of innovative solutions that are adapted to the * mediterranean ] region 's geographical needs and that are easily transferable
as the great ) croatian ] writer } predrag matvejevi ] once said and i quote being ) mediterranean ] entails more than history or geography tradition or memory birth right or belief
i think that part of that answer is exactly prima
but if you look at the * mediterranean ] region with ! one hundred and eighty million ] people that are considered water stressed this water stress was brought on by changing climate patterns but also by unsustainable resource management and demographic changes
i thank you for that because i think that it took the effort it took the capacity of us sitting around the table all together but we arrived at a conclusion that is really better than what we had before
mr } gambs ] talked also about the environmental angle of these problems which are definitely part of our ability to solve it or not
@ two thousand and fifty ] what we talked about @ today ] was also how we can have water for everybody
we have to solve this we have to create a technology we have to have the innovation that will change for the better and that is something that we will do together
ms } toia ] talked about a project of equals which is i think exactly what we want with prima on this project a project of equals in between all the countries with the same rights as partners and peers
the same manner must also be used when it investigates the alleged use of torture against the ) moroccan ] nationals implicated in the case and we must push in this house for there to be an independent criminal inquiry into the matter we are aware of the challenges that % tunisia ] faces after holding its ~ first ] free and democratic elections in this period of transition and for this reason we believe that a reform process must be fully implemented in order to establish a stronger and lasting multi party pluralist democracy in the long term in % tunisia ] and one that is based on human rights and the rule of law with an independent judiciary and an accountable police force and most importantly a free media
% tunisia ] has traditionally prided itself on sharing % eu ] common values in building a modern secular society
in the light of this recent commitment we must urge the ) tunisian ] government to do all it can to make sure that the authorities deal properly with the case brought forward by } zakaria bouguira ] in a transparent manner and in line with the law
as such we call on the ) tunisian ] authorities to carry on reforming the security forces and ending any climate of impunity
% tunisia ] should do away with these } ben ali ] style practices and oppression
they can be used to enable free speech freedom of the press and access to information and as this case shows the documentation of human rights violations
intended and is intended to support those who continue on the long difficult path of transition and the struggle towards free and just societies
besides respect for human rights the rule of law and good governance we are specifically concerned with the role that technologies can play
we are in contact with his family and the case has been formally raised with the competent authorities the minister of the interior and the minister of justice a judicial procedure has finally been opened and we will follow its development more generally this case shows the urgency for % tunisia ] to move more resolutely towards democratic transition
and ensure the independence of the judiciary a proper reform of the security sector freedom of the media and better democratic governance
at the political level the % eu ] has expressed to the ) tunisian ] authorities its willingness to support democratic reforms and will continue to do so in the future
we are also determined to translate these political commitments into concrete cooperation activities
in addition in response to a request from the minister for the interior we are currently discussing the possibility of a peer review of the security sector as a ~ first ] step towards increased dialogue and cooperation in this very sensitive sector
as experience has shown in order to succeed a democratic transition needs strong political will from the authorities but also an effective and organised civil society
we need to recognise this
this means that we should have from now on more time to reduce public deficits we should have more room to make public and private investments we should have better coordination of economic policies to sustain demand
but growth investment and job creation
and we should adopt another approach to reforms
we need reforms to create more added values to create more and better jobs and to create a new kind of global competitiveness for * europe ]
we need capital markets that are liquid all over the % european union ]
this is the most fundamental task for the % european union ] to preserve and defend peace
that means that we need to fight red tape to use the new opportunities of having a vice president of the commission responsible for better regulation and fighting bureaucracy
~ secondly ] we need to attract investment into the % european union ]
the aggression we see today from % russia ] is a threat to the peace order of today
@ two thousand and three ] we must not do it now because it will damage the credibility of the whole of the % european union ]
we can only attract investment if there is an opportunity for companies to profit for companies to develop
if we make new derogations for some countries just because they are big we are making a big mistake
so we need to ensure that our regulation and legislation is not hindering liquidity making and investment ~ thirdly ] we need to secure credibility and the stability of public finances in the % european union ]
the reforms to ) european ] economic governance have been instrumental in making this progress possible together we have changed the way that * europe ] 's economies and financial sector are legislated supervised and regulated
the situation in % ukraine ] is a clash of world views that touches the very heart of the % european union ] its principles its values and what it symbolises freedom democracy and rule of law
this is very important for restoring confidence
we need to continue contributing to a political solution
this is the basis for restoring and consolidating
own citizens the commission discussed this issue at @ todays ] college and will feed into a discussion at the ) european ]
public opinion in * europe ] accepted the targets of ! twenty ] ! twenty ] ! twenty ] by @ two thousand and twenty ] even if they were aware of the difficulties in implementing them
* west africa ] it is a challenge for the international community as a whole and * europe ] has a responsibility to
but developments afterwards have shown that the % union ] was and remains on the right side of the argument
in fact the % european union ] has invested a lot in the strategic partnership with the % russian federation ] convinced that it is in our common interest to cooperate
of law at the same time we are greatly concerned by the humanitarian and security situation in % syria ] and % iraq ] it is deteriorating dramatically day by day the rapid progression of ` isil ] is
we expect difficult discussions but we are confident that a decisive deal is within reach now
it faces i look forward to hearing your views here @ today ] on how we can work together to tackle these
by combining ! two ] strands environment and energy consensus was possible
our relations with our eastern neighbours are not detrimental to relations with the other neighbours we never sought exclusivity in our relations
they have put our union firmly into a position of global leadership and were widely recognised as a key contributor in the global fight against climate change
the ~ third ] issue to be discussed at the ` european council ] is the external situation in particular the conflict between % ukraine ] and % russia ] with the unsettled conflict in % ukraine ] we realise more than ever that to defend our values and protect our interests * europe ] needs to take the lead and be active
energy just @ today ] the commission is mediating another round of talks on the gas issue on the security front priority needs to be given to full implementation of the & minsk agreements ]
the % eu ] felt let down when a comprehensive global deal did not happen despite pressing others to follow suit
developments are still unfolding the % european union ] continues to work for a politically negotiated solution
alarming military action in line with international law is necessary but it is not enough it needs to be part of the wider effort comprising measures in the political and diplomatic counter terrorism and terrorism funding humanitarian and communication
there is now a renewed momentum towards a global binding climate treaty to be agreed in % paris ] @ next year ]
objectives humanitarian access should not be
yet sadly our ) european ] climate ambition is far from being matched by the ! two ] most important polluters globally the % united states ] and % china ]
we also broadened the scope to include energy security
agreeing a new framework on energy and climate policies for the period up to @ two thousand and thirty ] at this ` european council ] will show how credible we are in transforming our economies and societies towards a low carbon future
trust the ceasefire needs to be respected and verified
` council ] @ this week ] 's ` european council ] will cover very telling issues as far as the need for % european union ] unity is concerned what the % european union ] is for what it should do and what challenges
let me start with a few remarks on the economy @ this week ] 's meeting is not ! one ] for decisions in this regard
throughout the crisis yes our comprehensive response has always been built upon the ! three ] pillars of fiscal consolidation structural reforms and targeted investments
we need to attract private investment making better use of the financial instruments we have put in place
it is a choice for growth and this is what should be in our leaders minds at this upcoming summit
a fully functioning internal energy market connected to the global market is the key to security of supply and to the long term competitiveness of our industry
keeping our industry competitive and creating a real ) european ] market in energy with low prices and numerous supply sources is not a pragmatic choice
but i beg to differ and this is why for the completion of the single energy market we need to fill in the missing links in the infrastructure
focussing on a co two emissions reduction target that will keep our air clean is good but we must also allow member states to decide themselves how they want to streamline their efforts on renewables and energy efficiency because each competitiveness pole in * europe ] needs different policy tuning
that is why a general emissions reduction target with flexible implementation is the choice to make
the resources we need for infrastructure cannot be covered by public money
we need to get smart and we need direct access to the global energy market through multiple entry points
you are defending disrespect for sovereign countries and you are defending those who are threatening * europe ] 's peaceful order
you can do that because you are living in a free * europe ] but people like you are undermining our freedom
surely this is the sort of chamber where different groups can come together surely we can agree on less pollution
so we have to answer this fundamental question blue card me if you have an answer
it is nonsensical to consider them separately
surely we can agree on less dependence on unpleasant regimes whether in % russia ] or in the * middle east ] but we can also agree on more
we have to work with the rest of the world
it might well be found in someone 's garage by the } bill gates ] or the } steve jobs ] of the energy world
if we are to achieve a workable policy it is time to put aside this ideological debate between whether or not you agree with ! one ] group of climate scientists or another group of climate scientists
wave energy
some say clean coal
but we have to take a step back and ask the fundamental question in a modern digital economy with high speed rail and electric cars what will provide that energy
some say shale but the ) greens ] say no
we can agree on more energy efficiency and more conservation and we can agree on more energy security
the ) greens ] say no
so let us put aside those differences and work together
we cannot have a little ) european ] mentality
therefore the question and my question particularly to your group my ) green ] friends is what fills in the gaps some people will say nuclear but the ` greens ] say no
that is why we need to be pro market not necessarily pro big business
we need long term thinking and we need to work with industry not against it
of course
surely we can agree on less waste in landfill
otherwise we will never solve this challenge it is time to reclaim the green agenda for those who believe that being green and pro growth are ! two ] sides of the same coin
we can agree on more renewable energy
climate and energy policy must be for the long term
instead of politicians the commission or national governments trying to pick winners leave it to the market
the market will decide which will provide us with the sustainable energy for the future
yes i agree with you
i agree with you
let the innovators come forward and meet those challenges and you and i might find ourselves on the same side in the debate
so basically you know what the answer is
but would you not agree when you talk about cheap energy that if you want to transition our energy mix from where it is today to where it needs to be that requires investment and while you invest that increases your costs temporarily
so back to you as a financial person how do you manage the financial transition to make sure that you can afford the investments now to get to cheap energy tomorrow
many speakers paid attention to climate and energy policy which is an extremely important thing for * europe ] but also for the rest of the world
but if i just mention that this area is if i should mention one probably ! one ] of the biggest source of competitiveness if we just manage to deal with climate policy and energy policy together and the most effective way
mr president i would like to address my remarks to the ` council ] presidency about the summit and ebola it is good that you want to show leadership on this issue but we now need to turn the pledges into action into beds and specialised medical personnel on the ground
every member state needs to play its part and i hope you will be asking on @ thursday ] and @ friday ] for pledges from member states and that you will keep a grid of who is doing what and when things are getting done
it needs to be sorted out by the leaders of the % eu ]
the whole world is watching
i met the ) american ] ambassador @ today ]
we talked about this
otherwise we are not going to be leaders in the world
so please show leadership make sure we get a deal make sure we tackle the real underlying issues on ebola and then the citizens of * europe ] will believe that the % eu ] can tackle the big problems facing our societies
as far as the esf is concerned the close alignment of its priorities with the employment guidelines provides for a direct link between % eu ] employment policy priorities and % eu ] financial support
this effort involves close cooperation between relevant commission services and between the commission and relevant regional and local authorities
! one hundred and seventy four ] in addition & article one hundred and seventy six ] points out that the european regional development fund is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the % union ] through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions
i hope that i have responded to some of your questions and i look forward to an interesting debate
the @ december two thousand and eight ] communication of the ` commission on cohesion ] policy investing in real economy underlined the importance of the policy for focusing on the % eu ] lisbon agenda delivery investing in people business research and innovation priority infrastructures and energy
the strengths of multi level governance were also stressed by the ` committee of the regions ] in its white paper of @ june two thousand and nine ] where it called on the % union ] to strengthen mechanisms of multi level governance and pointed to the leverage effects generated by cohesion policy which contributed to the implementation of other community policies as well on your ! two ] questions concerning the eventual abandonment of
objective ! two ] and the eligibility of all ) european ] regions in the period @ two thousand and seven ] @ two thousand and thirteen ] all regions are eligible for structural funds support
it offers a governance system which values and exploits local and regional knowledge combines it with strategic direction from the community level and coordinates interventions between levels of government
the growing interdependence between different levels of government in the % union ] was stressed by the consultation paper launched by the commission on the eu two thousand and twenty strategy
human capital investments financed by the esf form an essential component of this policy mix in the context of the global knowledge based economy
policy conclusions resulting from the public debate on the green paper on territorial cohesion will instead be incorporated in the comprehensive cohesion policy legislative package for post @ two thousand and thirteen ] prepared in the context of the ~ fifth ] cohesion report which according to the new treaty is due for submission
a practical example of cooperation between the commission services is the practical guide to % eu ] funding opportunities for research and innovation published @ in two thousand and seven ] which was conceived to help potential beneficiaries to find their way through the three funding community instruments and provides policy makers with advice on coordinated access to those instruments
the commission 's current focus is on ensuring that the implementation of the planned investments can be delivered in partnership with national and regional authorities as effectively as possible
larger shares of the % eu ] budget will need to be devoted to such an agenda at the expense of regions such as % wales ]
but % wales ] cannot afford to pay if nothing is paid back out
even fewer will have to carry even more with a possible loss of the rebate for the % uk ] with more countries queuing up to join the % eu ] i am concerned % wales ] will see much needed support go to newer member states
instead a sectoral approach to the new budget is adopted rather than operating independently within current structures
the consequences will include reductions in programme budgets less investment in the wider economy in % wales ] and broad reaching loss of jobs connected to programme management and project delivery
not only does this mean that net contributors will lose further return funding but those member states expected to join the % european union ] under future expansion would enter membership under cohesion funding likely to remain for the forthcoming budgetary duration
instead the % eu ] like a wolf in sheep 's clothing is covertly abandoning cooperation and compromise in favour of consolidation
whereas the people of * europe ] were told the % union ] on the grounds that it enhanced trade links strengthened agriculture ties and promoted equality the machinations of an increasing bureaucratic global * europe ] see the focus on farming and regional development decrease in favour of an unwanted ambitious global strategy including increased emigration to countries like the % uk ]
it seems increasingly likely that the level of funding available to % wales ] will reduce substantially
the proposal to limit the policy to national level would lead to qualifying member states governing redistribution
rather than having any sort of beneficial effect on my constituents the % eu ] will serve a glancing blow to the people of % wales ] if they decide to pull the rug from under our feet the likely result of the reduction in funding to % wales ] and the % uk ] will have a major impact on our country as a whole which will affect the farming sector as well
as a result those countries who currently shoulder a large proportion of the % union ] 's financial burden like the % uk ] will discover they must finance an ever increasing pool of member states qualifying for support
it now must be time that the people of % wales ] and the % uk ] have a referendum on its relations with the % european union ] so the people can decide if they want to be governed by % westminster ] or % brussels ]
it is no surprise that some of * europe ] 's richest countries like % norway ] and % switzerland ] have given the % european union ] a wide berth knowing that they would be paying to fund their poorer neighbours
the last payments to projects under the @ two thousand and seven ] @ two thousand and thirteen ] ) eu ] structural funds programmes will be made in
the move reinforces the % european union ] 's increasing ambition to become further integrated centralised and federal yet abandons the regional dimension of cohesion policy which underpins the % european union ] 's pledge to support territorial cohesion and deliver benefits to all members
the implication that cohesion might disappear entirely from richer nations with no mention at all of transitional funding would further disenfranchise the people of the % uk ] the disproportionate membership bill would be better steered towards funding economic development through self sufficiency determined by the % uk ] itself
therefore if the proposals suggested by the commission are brought forward i believe it would have huge political consequences in areas like % wales ]
mr president % wales ] is probably the most positively ) european ] area in the % uk ] and the reason for that is that every community almost every individual and many organisations benefit from ) european ] funding formerly objective one and now convergence funding
) european ] cohesion that makes the single market work is delivered by the ) european ] regional policy which is today based exactly on this triple foundation competitiveness cooperation and solidarity
there is a need to move further on those issues to continue the reform of policy governance but certain principles should not be abandoned
that is why more than @ two years ago ] the regions @ two thousand and twenty ] analytical report was published
cohesion policy is a policy for development that engages all levels of ) european ] governance working in concert for ) european ] citizens to conclude * europe ] needs new energy to take care of its future to renew itself in an assertive way it is legitimate to ask where this energy could and should come
we policy makers have raised the stakes by promising to deliver the challenges are well known
experience and logic clearly show that this mobilisation turns out to be most effective and efficient if pursued through the direct engagement of subnational levels of ) european ] governments
@ for years ] we have talked about the need to unlock to mobilise the development potential of all ) european ] regions and cities
in years to come the * europe ] we live in will be in need of strong collective action to respond to the expectations of its citizens who are @ today ] informed citizens fully aware of how much depends on choices made by policy makers
from for me the answer is clear
all elements of this integration triangle common market common currency cohesion are mutually strengthening and interdependent they are our common ) european ] public good
} jacques delors ] once said that the ) european ] single market is about competition that stimulates about cooperation that makes us stronger and about solidarity that makes us united
@ two thousand and ten ] in the course of @ the coming months ] the questions and problems raised here should find proper responses from the commission
the area that is causing me most concern is the suggestion to deprioritise the competitiveness objectives
these competitiveness objectives have been vital in creating rural and regional development particularly the technology parks which have helped to drive the smart economy and will be needed more so into the future
i hope these things will be addressed in the forthcoming white paper as well as the opportunities that exist in synergies between research innovation and regional development
like my colleague i too would be concerned about rural development policy albeit not as part of the cohesion policy more in line with the & cap ] but at the same time it is absolutely vital that it is not squeezed in any future proposals because rural development and particularly the family farm is vital for the social infrastructure of society
finally i just want to say also that more needs to be done in combating fraud
these are young skilled workers and graduates who deserve an opportunity to participate and contribute to the economy who deserve to have pride and respect in their work and who deserve commitment and leadership from us as policymakers
@ two thousand and eight ] recent figures show that in * europe ] @ last year ] ! seven five million ] people aged between @ eighteen ] and @ twenty nine ] were not in employment education or training
the negative if not realist view is that for these people their earnings will never catch up with those of their peers many face long term unemployment demoralisation and social problems
for real % eu ] growth to happen it is imperative that every action is taken at every level to address this growing social and economic problem before the effects are irreversible for this generation and they become trapped in a vicious cycle
the & european youth guarantee ] is a welcome initiative and one that has the potential to make a difference for the generations affected however it is an initiative which requires leadership and commitment from member state leaders if it is to have any impact
what is important for all of us is to steady the course to continue to show determination both in the direction of responsibility and solidarity
can only be resolved by addressing the structural problems in our economies
the priority must now be given to the implementation of the ) european ] growth strategy and the elements are there
that is why we urgently need an agreement on the multiannual financial framework to make full use of the ) european ] levers for growth
the commission will continue to work constructively with the ` european parliament ] and the ` council ] to have these proposals adopted i believe this is a matter of priority
~ third ] promoting growth and competitiveness for today and for tomorrow
the ` board of governors of the investment bank ] is expected to formally approve the ( eur one hundred billion ] capital increase in @ the coming weeks ] and the ` eib ] 's lending programme for the @ next three years ] will already reflect the bank 's increased lending capacity we are certainly an economic union
those are priorities which are structural and it certainly will take time before we fully benefit from their realisation
in as the ` european council ] meets @ today ] to consider the path towards a more genuine economic and monetary union the commission urges the leaders to listen to the voice of the directly elected ` parliament ] which represents * europe ] 's citizens so that together we can continue to build a * europe ]
~ first ] differentiated growth friendly fiscal consolidation
regarding current account surpluses the commission is carrying out a horizontal analysis on the policy implications of large and sustained current account surpluses
investment across * europe ] and we cannot speak about the need for growth without recognising the critical need for targeted investment
the ) european ] budget is at ) european ] level the most important instrument for this targeted investment
postponing consolidation for them is not an option
if we want to deliver growth across * europe ] we must have a budget that can deliver investment across * europe ] and that creates these conditions for growth
for those member states with greater fiscal room for manoeuvre the automatic stabiliser can play its role and the & stability and growth pact ] allows for this
more can be done in this last area for instance in the fields of public procurement digitisation of public administration and improving the quality and independence of judicial systems by making the judicial systems a contribution to confidence and growth
continued reform is needed to generate the conditions for sustainable growth and jobs and that is why the commission in its annual growth survey for @ two thousand and thirteen ] has stressed the following ! five ] priorities
results are due in the @ first half of two thousand and thirteen ] and will support the ) european ] semester recommendation as appropriate
~ fourth ] tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis
~ second ] restoring normal lending to the economy
lastly i want to refer to the capital increase of the ` european investment bank ]
furthermore the @ two thousand and thirteen ] commission work programme takes forward key growth initiatives already on the table and makes new proposals
the commission has also made its point on the so called fiscal multipliers in stressing the need for an intelligent composition of fiscal consolidation measures for member states that have lost access to financial markets there is simply no choice
it is time to take forward the measures proposed
we have also put a large number of initiatives in place to promote growth and jobs both in the short and in the medium term while maintaining overall fiscal discipline
! two ] those can really unlock the potential of the single market as well as the priorities of the @ two thousand and thirteen ] annual growth survey we know that these measures are specific measures and we know that the real issue of social justice and prosperity
mr president the commission has put forward a comprehensive strategy for growth in * europe ]
stabilising the euro area certainly ! one ] of the most important if not the most urgent issues now tackling all the necessary measures to instil confidence in the ) european ] economy because without confidence there will be no investment and without investment there will be no possibility for growth and growth is the answer to the current problems of * europe ]
all the elements of this report in my > two minutes ] but i just want to highlight ! two ]
this is the biggest unexploited opportunity to get jobs really moving and to get those essential small businesses off the ground
our history shows that it is small enterprises that have consistently created more jobs than in any other sector @ over the last ten years ]
in the services area where we have created new opportunities for businesses to get information to start businesses easily in other countries we must exploit that
but most governments are not promoting these opportunities
they are not using the tools that we have already put in place
every week i get a fresh report showing the importance of investment in digital infrastructure and its exploitation by business in creating jobs
i want to thank } viviane reding ] for the part that she played in this when she was commissioner for communications and telecommunications
we need to take advantage of this
we need to get more businesses online
that is the ! one ] growth area in our economy
the latest reports show that the % european union ] is the largest region in the world for e commerce
now that is a huge prize to be exploited
why are we not engaging our governments with the support of the commission and others in using these tools and coming out and creating those new jobs and opportunities
mr president the investment famine is forcing ! millions ] onto the dole reducing living standards and relentlessly depressing the domestic economy the crippling banking debt loaded onto the shoulders of taxpayers is freezing country after country out of the sovereign bond market
banks which are awash with cash could simply be instructed to lend for investment and growth which would provide much needed social capital create employment and bring about recovery
the obstacle to growth is not a lack of fiscal discipline
you cannot cut and tax your way out of that crisis
on behalf of the ` council ] may i wish you all the best for the future
it is particularly significant for us that the @ five years ] of this legislature have coincided with the ~ first ] @ five years ] of membership of the % european union ] for the % czech republic ] and for the other countries which joined at that time
i would ~ first ] like to pay tribute to you mr president for the exemplary manner in which you have led this institution throughout @ the last two and a half years ]
there will be many new members
moreover as the poet } emerson ] taught us there is no such thing as history only biography
i hope you will write about your experiences and impressions
you were elected on the basis of a worthy pledge to engage our house in intercultural dialogue but your record reaches further than that
on parliamentary procedures you oversaw the reforms that many of us have long called for and through initiatives like europarl tv you have supported modern methods of communicating with our citizens
it will be interesting to see what plans future presidents will bring to expand on the role that you have played projecting the common values and principles that we hold dear
although i will not sit in this seat again i know you are aware that i am keen to try sitting where you are
but @ today ] i think i can speak for many when i say that you have earned our respect and affection
having led my group @ since two thousand and two ] i have a touch of what we call in ^ english ] the @ seven year ] itch
it will be more powerful still under the lisbon treaty if and when it is eventually ratified
on members allowances you concluded the vital work started by } pat cox ]
that is a record to be proud of and a legacy on which your successors should build
our groups may not always agree but during your mandate you have proven an honest fair and unifying figure one whose modesty masks your many achievements
they will be too interesting to be left in the cold and powerful hands of oblivion
this ` parliament ] has become more powerful over the years
instead let me say this the president of this chamber is meant to embody the entire house including those who espouse minority views and when you treat us differently you open the door to despotism
in all the time i have known you first as leader of the ) christian democrats ] and then as president of this ` parliament ] you have been a model of dignity restraint and courtesy
you chose arbitrarily to disapply those rules you did not seek to change them which would have required a certain amount of time you simply disregarded them
you will be very relieved no doubt to hear that i cannot recall ever having agreed with you but in the career that we have both chosen we know that ideological commitment is a rare commodity and we value it even when we find it in an opponent
those of us who wanted referendums on the & constitutional treaty ] had made our point in peaceable explanations of vote
for example virtually every month there are demonstrations here about something or other and they are tolerated but when we held up placards with the ! one ] word referendum you sent in the ushers to snatch away our banners and several of us were later fined
all organisations need their critics
my friends i hope that there will be many more of us souverainistes here in @ july ] for the ~ first ] time in @ fifty years ] this ` parliament ] will have something in the nature of an official opposition
it made you feel vulnerable and that made you tetchy and since you could hardly attack the voters directly you took out all your frustration on us the visible ) eurosceptic ] minority in this chamber
but from your own point of view i would urge you to be a bit more even handed in your dealings with those of us who are the minority
colleagues i do not expect to change your minds about the desirability of centralising power in % brussels ]
if only you could conquer your reflexive dislike for us you might find that it would bolster your own democratic credentials
it will be up to your successor } hans gert ] how to deal with that opposition but i hope he will live up to the value of tolerance which this chamber keeps claiming to espouse
i can understand why the word referendum causes so much disquiet in this chamber the electorates of ! three ] nations had rejected your constitutional model
your insistence that the % eu ] is an absolute good and that any criticism of it is either dishonest or xenophobic has done you no favours because without critical scrutiny the % brussels ] institutions become bloated self serving and corrupt
you will remember how we clashed over your interpretation of this house 's & rules of procedure ]
mr president some colleagues may find this hard to believe but i am going to miss you
our right to do so was set out unequivocally in the rules of procedure
this is not the time to have that argument all over again
i hope in the @ next four weeks ] in this campaign that the voters of * europe ] can see the real face of this project
you are bullying
you are anti democratic
the defining moment for me in this house was when we had the ) french ] say no we had the ) dutch ] say no and then we had the ) irish ] say no and this ` parliament ] wilfully carried on ignoring the wishes of the people
you are a complete shower
but sadly as president } vclav klaus ] pointed out when he came here you do not actually think there should be any alternative view and as a result of that your presidency has been marked by your deeply prejudicial manner in the way in which you have treated the members of this house who have stood up and opposed the constitution
you are threatening
if you believed in democracy you would not just bulldoze aside those ! three ] referendum results
you are nationalistic
well he may have a point i do not know but } danny cohn bendit ] that great champion of free speech said that opponents of the treaty were mentally ill and } martin schulz ] the leader of the ` socialists ] said after ! one ] of the no votes that we must not bow to populism and that the no votes opened the door to fascism
no means no and it is truly incredible that ! four hundred and ninety nine ] members of this house voted to ignore the ) irish ] no vote and to continue with the treaty
yes because we have been providing the voice of opposition and in a democracy opposition is essential
but ! one ] thing does worry me which is that we must always balance security with freedom of expression and the right to privacy
but these can be safeguarded only in a free open and secure cyberspace
besides harmonisation of legislation it should be recognised that companies cannot deal with the challenge alone and new regulation should provide more and efficient legal tools and incentives encouraging safer behaviour by service providers and users
technological development allowed a previously unforeseen level of convenience ease of use of services and well being
we recognise and respect that
with regard to encryption mentioned by a number of you when it comes to encryption in criminal investigations we are reviewing possible options and possible ways forward and we will revert both to the ` council ] and to this house
it explicitly encourages more proactive measures to tackle this scourge
we take a technologically neutral approach but we want to facilitate cross border cooperation and ensure that this crime is treated as seriously as it deserves to be
both network and centre would contribute to increased investment and reinforce capabilities across the % european union ]
sadly it will continue and will continue to grow as long as it does appear to pay so we also need to take steps as well as building our resilience to improve deterrents and to make cybercrime easier to detect trace and prosecute
once that is fully implemented it will improve national cybersecurity capabilities enhance cooperation between member states and require operators in important economic sectors such as energy transport banking and health as well as digital service providers to adopt risk management measures and report major incidents to national authorities
the annual # safer internet day ] is a flagship event promoting awareness amongst children teachers and parents
resilience means being harder to attack and quicker to respond so a proposed cybersecurity act would revise the mandate of ` enisa ] and reinforce it we are also proposing to introduce an % eu ] certification framework for internet connected products and services
the commission is considering launching a major % eu ] wide campaign covering online safety and cybersecurity for minors
building on the cybersecurity public private partnership the commission has said that we want to create a network of cybersecurity competence centres and a new ) european ] cybersecurity research and competence centre at its hub
@ next year ] 's # safer internet day ] is on @ six february ]
we want law enforcement agencies to have the tools they need to tackle online crime effectively
however some of the attacks that we have seen recently like the # wannacry ] attack and the # not petya ] attack showed the need to do even more on resilience and on preparedness
they can be achieved at a surprisingly low cost but with devastating effect and they pose a risk to our security and sometimes to our democratic processes and institutions which is why we need to promote our cybersecurity and that indeed was the objective of the package of measures the commission issued on @ nineteen september ] as a number of you have suggested
i want to thank you again for your engagement on these issues
we have the & directive on the security of network and information systems ]
it has a key role in maintaining effective cybersecurity
but we recognise and we agree that strong encryption is key to how we use the internet
our communication @ last week ] on tackling illegal content online also set out guidelines to encourage more effective identification and removal of illegal content including material in relation to child sexual abuse
madam president this is an important and timely report on how our society deals with new emerging issues of safety and security online
these issues impact our private and public lives as well as the way we conduct our democratic politics
we must balance the need for safety online with privacy and we must guarantee freedom of expression and association while combating incitement to violence and radicalisation
it is also crucial that we protect our democratic institutions and elections from being hijacked such as during the % uk ] referendum or recently in the % us ] elections
we must legislate to prevent data mining companies like ` cambridge analytica ] using secret money to harvest private data and use it to disseminate disinformation as reported by the investigative journalist } carole cadwalladr ]
these are new challenges and only a large global actor like the % eu ] can take action to tackle them
it is an opportunity to examine the implementation of the multiannual financial framework and as the rapporteurs have said this is not a usual period in the history of the % european union ]
we have broadly speaking an agreement on the fact that we have to sharpen the link between money and priorities and make sure that we address top priorities with top euros
and how to make sure that the external challenges of * europe ] are buffered appropriately with the use of our budget
needs have gone up and resources are tighter
the young people who are jobless in * europe ] how to make sure that we have the capacity to address the flows of people coming seeking rescue or out of hopelessness
from the commission side i can tell you that we are working with all we have to make the budget deliver more bigger and better results for our people to stretch every
euro to the maximum and to use our great creativity and flexibilities to do more with the money we have
these are not easy questions and i can say that there are areas where there is very strong agreement and there are areas where there would be a lot of work to do where we are in agreement is that we have to expand the flexibility of the budget
in this context what we have in our hands is for the ~ first ] time in the history of the % european union ] a smaller budget than the ! one ] we had before
we also know that the ` monti group ] is due to produce its report on own resources and that is going to be an incredibly sensitive and yet critical issue for the future of the % european union ]
we also have to simplify our rules to use the revision of the financial regulation to make it easier for money to get to where it is designated to go
@ since two thousand and eight ] we have gone from one crisis to another
there are also very difficult questions and i am not going to shy away from those the expectations in ` council ] and in ` parliament ] in terms of what we would deliver are quite diverse
over everything we fund from the sacrifice of our taxpayers
! three ] and ~ secondly ] and i believe this is really essential we need to repeal the provision in the mff regulation that stipulates that the contingency margin has to be offset
this provision means that every time we mobilise this margin we decrease the budget in other areas we all have to understand that new priorities have to be financed with new funds with fresh money
what does this mean
looking to the future we will have to modernise the budget significantly and modernisation is not only on the expenditure side
it moves from one place to another but in a world that is unfortunately so severely undermined by conflicts and violent extremism given the geography which we have in * europe ] there are no walls that can be built to stop the flow of people
we do that with the internal market but of course the budget is the fuel for this convergence engine
weather that comes with unmitigated climate change
we have to use the mid term review to see how we can do better in terms of aligning the budget with the priorities in a fast moving world
i have listened very carefully and i want to start from the recognition that came from many of you that we have a new budget for a reason and the reason is that in the % eu ] we have invented ! one ] of the best achievements of the @ twentieth century ]
how can we get more innovation to generate smes that push * europe ] forward in competitive terms
but until the government actually triggers & article fifty ] uncertainty is going to continue everywhere
the ) british ] government needs to hurry up it needs to get a prime minister chosen and it needs to start the process
they think that it is a delaying tactic for ) british ] politicians to try to wriggle out of the result
we all need certainty
the % european union ] has changed the issues have changed the world has changed and indeed it makes sense that you would want to make sure that you plan for that
to raise the ceilings for both payments and commitment appropriations and the creation of a permanent crisis reserve to address the short term crisis without cutting into the long term policies that are vital for addressing the root causes so in these turbulent times i think it is really vital that the % eu ] stands for its values as the world 's largest aid donor supporting the most vulnerable globally
at the same time the ongoing turbulence in * africa ] and elsewhere will be detrimental to our own future security and the consequences of climate change are plain for all to see we have seen a spike in natural disasters across the world that is why our committee wants a genuine revision that increases heading ! four ]
we should be spending more of the % eu ] budget on creating growth and jobs
so for example we should be spending more of the budget on structural funds to create investment in infrastructure and training projects
we should be supporting the continuation of the youth employment initiative as youth unemployment remains a scandal right across the % european union ]
we should also be supporting more investment in innovation research and development for our businesses and for our universities
we also need a more flexible budget to deal with crises as they arise
for example the refugee crisis has been mentioned but also we have a crisis because of # brexit ] there is no doubt that regions across the % eu ] will now face a cut in funding because of that
every time the ` european parliament ] discusses the situation in % russia ] its counterparts in % moscow ] express their discontent about foreigners getting involved in their domestic home affairs
the demonstrations by ) russian ] citizens show that people want free and fair elections
i do not think it really reflects the attitudes of ) russians ]
on my recent visits to % russia ] i found really very deep discontent with the decline in democracy in that very important country
what we say in our official statements in relation to % russia ] is very modest
this so called managed democracy might be acceptable in % egypt ] where my friend } ayman nour ] has been prevented from standing as a candidate in the presidential elections but it is wholly ridiculous that } grigory yavlinsky ] has been banned from standing as a presidential candidate in % russia ]
there remains the question of the behaviour of the ) russian ] voters
the ` bbc ] is guilty of gross journalistic irresponsibility and this shows once again that ) putin ] 's is a gangster regime
the ` kremlin ] had accused ` mi six ] of funding ) russian ] human rights groups and other ngos and using a fake rock located in a % moscow ] square filled with electronic equipment to communicate with their secret agents
the ` fsb ] reacted promptly publicly accusing ! two ] leading ngos ` memorial ] and ` golos ] of being subversive and extremist organisations funded by * the west ]
it seems to me that this is a politically motivated move and a blatant disregard of democratic principles and international standards which will deny the ) russian ] people the choice of an open democratic modern ) european ] perspective
his supporters collected ! over two five million ] signatures in ! seventy one ] regions of the % russian federation ] between @ twenty four december ] and @ ten january ] the only time really open to them including getting notaries to check them and the electoral commission has declared ! twenty ] of them invalid
e } konkin ] who is the secretary of the ` central electoral commission ] this is the commission which has rejected the approach by } grigory yavlinsky ] of the ` yabloko ] to be a candidate for the presidency
the party is now being investigated by the public prosecutor of % moscow ] who is asking where the server of its website is located
recently differences have emerged about how to deal with the growing crisis in % syria ]
the important cooperation however difficult with % russia ] over % georgia ] and % moldova ] which are both engaged in efforts to resolve protracted conflicts
some limited political reforms have been launched and yet the protests that began in @ december ] we see are set to continue
honourable members will recall that we debated % russia ] in our % strasbourg ] session on @ thirteen december two thousand and eleven ] and the concerns that were raised in this house about the ` duma ] elections were raised with president } medvedev ] at our summit that followed shortly afterwards you will recall that those concerns focused in particular on the exclusion of parties from the elections president } medvedev ] talked to us about those concerns and explained that a necessary political evolution was taking place
it is true that % russia ] disagreed with the international community 's approach to % libya ] and said that the action taken went beyond the mandate given by the ` security council ] i have discussed this with the foreign minister of % russia ] mr } lavrov ] several times but it is also clear that we cannot let the ) syrian ] people pay the price for past disagreements
% iran ] is of particular concern @ this year ]
mr president when societies change political systems need to change too
there is a growing group of people calling for real participation for more decisive measures to rein in corruption and impunity and for more breathing space for democratic processes
the % eu ] is % russia ] 's most important trading partner and % russia ] is our ~ third ] largest trading partner
the ) russian ] leadership should now act swiftly on the problems identified by the ` osce ] and do its utmost in the short time left to hold free and fair presidential elections @ next month ]
we are well prepared to support and encourage a domestic political process in % russia ] that aims to develop its democratic institutions and the rule of law as well as a modern economy and a vibrant civil society whose human rights are respected and whose aspirations for a more open and dynamic society are matched by the reforms undertaken by its government
they are ready to express these opinions peacefully
we share close historical cultural social and economic ties
we will continue our support for modernising both % russia ] 's economic basis and the foundations for a dynamic society oriented towards the future
as already discussed the lack of progress in the talks has left us with no choice but to adopt our new round of sanctions and i have discussed in this house this evening the purpose of those sanctions and how important it is that we work closely with the e thirty three and of course in that context with % russia ] let me mention as well in the context of our discussions on difficult issues
more often than not making these changes is less risky and uncertain than not making them
as these examples show we work intensively with % russia ] on international issues albeit not without difficulty but there is often a desire to find common ground and enable the international community to respond
the movement has grown
@ one thousand nine hundred and seventy three ] as a permanent member of the security council % russia ] needs to take its responsibilities for international peace and security seriously old alliances may matter but the fate of the people of % syria ] matters much more
he said this was due to improved living standards a more active civil society and the development of social media and he emphasised that the government was drawing lessons
with ! thousands ] of people killed and violence escalating across % syria ] we strongly urge % russia ] to join the international consensus and allow the ` security council ] to act on the basis of the ` arab league ] proposals and the joint draft resolution
nevertheless they want to see real change and ` osce ] observers have raised real issues about registration about access to electronic media and about the lack of separation between state and governing party we are moving forward to engage in dialogue with the protestors and of course the opposition
the launch of the common steps towards visa free travel opens the prospect of visas being abolished and there was consensus at the summit that we should reinvigorate negotiations on a new agreement
we have seen that the ) russian ] leadership at least in theory has acknowledged the need for change
as i said at the beginning of my contribution we know it is the least risky option if i can put it like that
there is a lot of work and many reforms ahead
the different concerns that have been expressed in the house are enormously significant
i want to comment on some of the specific issues that have been raised
we understand that the president of the ` central election committee ] is going to have to explain himself in the ` duma ] and there are questions there which we need to come back to and which we will continue to raise with % russia ]
} helga schmidt ] whom i mentioned earlier was in % moscow ] until @ today ] and has been meeting with them on my behalf over @ the last couple of days ]
it depends greatly on the % eu ] market and that is extremely important in our relationship with % russia ] i agree that opinion is shifting and that the new president will need to think about how he governs differently
a number of you described your visits to % russia ] and talks with individuals about how things are beginning to change the policy that we are trying to develop is a good one but it requires us to look at % russia ] from a bilateral set of relationships as international partners on many things and at the responsibilities that we
have together in the international community
) russian ] civil society is very important but i would say to those who have raised this issue that the relationship between this ` parliament ] and civil society is also extremely valuable
many times in the course of our deliberations about what has happened in * north africa ] in what is now called the # arab spring ] or the ) arab ] uprising i have raised the fact that members of ` parliament ] are critically important in explaining and discussing with people the value and importance of democracy what it can bring
and how to engage with it
mr } batten ] the important point you make for me is that ` golos ] and ` memorial ] should be allowed to work freely and i agree with you on that
i agree too on the importance of the bigger picture and also of the smaller details and that we need to have the tough discussions with % russia ] that mr } svensson ] talked about we also know that there is a great deal of interest in the % european union ]
the ` eurasian union ] which is much talked about now and which i discussed with deputy prime minister } shuvalov ] when i was there in @ november ] is in a sense inspired by the way that the % european union ] works ms } vaidere ] i know very well the concerns in % latvia ] about the language issue and i know that it is very sensitive but i am quite sure that the ) latvian ] authorities will handle this well
in conclusion this has been an important debate as we continue to try to develop the relationship with % russia ] on the one hand we see the advantages now within the ` world trade organization ] and the capacity we have to develop those trade relationships we see a more active civil society with which we can engage we can
we see the need to continue to press on some of the basic issues that have been quite rightly raised here about the way that the internal situation in % russia ] is developing then there is % russia ] as an international player with whom we work on issues such as % iran ] we are increasingly trying to work with it on % syria ] and on other areas where working together in the ` security council ] and the importance of collaboration
i think it is for that reason i take a special interest in % russia ]
at this stage we must also reflect on what the % european union ] will do to support the implementation of the financing for development outcome and the post @ two thousand and fifteen ] agenda
i agree that the % european union ] must keep up its level of ambition and commitments on oda including through the implementation of the development effectiveness principles i also welcome your comments on issues that go beyond oda
indeed the @ two thousand and fifteen ] edition of the report was published @ last month ]
this includes a comprehensive approach to supporting domestic resource mobilisation in developing countries and tackling tax avoidance and tax evasion
on the question of monitoring and follow up we must remain ambitious
we are carefully considering how the % european union ] 's policies might need to be reviewed to help promote the new agenda
but we should also reflect on how we can strengthen that process within the context of a wider @ post two thousand and fifteen ] monitoring and accountability framework
so tax is crucial and that is why we need concrete measures to tackle tax problems
that is money that would pay for decent healthcare and it would pay to tackle childhood malnutrition i think those who are dodging those taxes need to know that they are literally taking money out of the mouths of babes
if we do not get a deal there it will be harder in those subsequent conferences
to tackle these problems we need concrete proposals and we have heard some > tonight ]
we need companies and individuals to pay their fair share of tax and some of these concrete measures are in the } schlein ] report
the ` oecd ] has estimated that if we could increase tax revenue by ! one ] in developing countries it would be like doubling oda
the # addis conference ] is a priority for the % european union ]
we need a true global partnership to achieve such a broad agenda
there are still difficulties around the ` un committee on tax ] and its upgrading to an intergovernmental
the commission concurs with the general analysis of this very comprehensive report
path as part of a global partnership initiative we will be organising a side event on the margins of the % addis ] conference and are developing a document as a ~ first ] basis for discussion under the title collect more spend better
this makes the % european union ] collectively the world 's largest donor we have recommitted to achieving the official development assistance target of
body we should focus on the substance not on taking decisions on the format at this stage of the process
regrettably this commitment has not been followed by other developed and emerging donors
will be dedicated to addressing environment and climate change objectives
we need an ambitious and coherent engagement and agreement covering all means of implementation aid investment and domestic resources as well as an enabling policy environment
improved domestic resource mobilisation can indeed significantly contribute to a more sustainable and reliable sourcing of revenue
in % addis ] and % new york ] we have a unique opportunity to redefine global development cooperation for the years to
we need an integrated transparent and reliable framework to keep track not only of our financial commitments but also of overall progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals we all have been working hard for an ambitious # addis ] outcome document one that reflects % eu ] aspirations and objectives
the % european union ] negotiations have been challenging
the % european union ] has been well prepared and ready to play its constructive and leading role throughout the negotiations and beyond including through some concrete figures for instance ( eur fifty eight billion ] for official development assistance
the commission is committed to ensuring that the developing countries which have the ambition for reform are supported in this difficult
all countries need to act and contribute their fair share and so does the private sector and civil society the % european union ] stands ready to play its full part in implementing the sustainable development goals at home and through our external actions
body we clearly support giving developing countries a stronger voice and participation in the definition of the global tax governance agenda without necessarily creating yet another intergovernmental
the old days of north and south donors and beneficiaries are over
and i am delighted that ! six ] of you will be joining the % european union ] delegation attending the conference
together with the representatives from national governments we will make sure that the % european union ] and its member states continue to speak with ! one ] voice in these last crucial stages
madam president this report seems to me to be barking up the wrong tree attempting to solve a peripheral symptom of the real problem in developing nations that of corruption
% nigeria ] is a prime example of how governmental corruption has nurtured an environment of low investor confidence which has allowed corporations to abuse the free market by investing in the countries with the most disjointed tax evasion laws and ethos
this report states that transparency is the key in holding tax evaders accountable
these countries are not blessed with the scale of technological advancements we enjoy
before the issue of tax avoidance can be addressed properly corruption must be dealt with in developing nations
the ` eib ] will promote % eu ] policies whilst managing its operations in accordance with the principles of sound banking practices
this is similar in size to the current mandate of ( eur twenty nine ]
moreover the proposed decision reinforces the cooperation between the bank the commission and the ` european external action service ] and further enhances transparency and promotes broad stakeholder consultation on ` european investment bank ] operations
mr president i would like to highlight that this is a cost effective way of promoting % eu ] external policies owing to the leverage effect of the guarantee mechanism the total cost to the % eu ] budget for providing the ( eur twenty seven billion ] guarantee for ` eib ] external operations is ( eur one three billion ]
the % eu ] guarantee will complement the ` eib ] 's own risk operations and will add value by supporting local private sector development in particular by providing support to smes through the development of social and economic infrastructure including transport energy and environmental infrastructure
it will allow the ` european investment bank ] to continue investing in * north africa ] following the # arab spring ] including investment to promote growth and create jobs
but we have had free elections for the ~ first ] time in decades in these ! three ] countries
~ first ] of all i take pride in the fact that there is a long waiting list of countries who want to join
the bank already has a priority project pipeline in % ukraine ] of up to ( eur one five ]
! eight billion ] ceiling for the & eastern neighbourhood ] in the proposed decision is sufficient to cover this increase of ` eib ] operations in % ukraine ] in the short term and there is scope to increase this further under the flexibility to reallocate across regions
~ first ] of all we are not an inward looking % european union ] it is true that there is that & english ] proverb which says charity begins at home which is the most abused proverb in the ^ english ] language
right now we have this country % ukraine ] which has a strong ) european ] perspective
following the mid term review as i said in my opening speech there is also the option to activate the optional mandate of ( eur three billion ]
~ first ] of all % ukraine ] is ! one ] of the eligible countries under the proposed decision so if we vote in favour of this decision @ today ] we are indirectly also helping % ukraine ]
of course not
! billion ] for the @ next three years ] and could significantly scale this up if adequate guarantee provisions are granted and if the political and operational conditions allow it
we have invested so much politically in * north africa ] that we cannot abandon them to their fate and the projects financed by the ` european investment bank ] in * north africa ] are a way of doing politics of doing foreign policy in our neighbourhood
in the period @ from two thousand and fourteen to two thousand and twenty ] the ` eib ] is encouraged to continue pursuing its greener path by strengthening its emissions performance standards and launching a public review of the climate impact of its lending portfolio
we should make an evaluation of the social impact of its operation and human rights considerations will have a more central role in the bank 's lending
we expect that the board of the ` eib ] will strengthen the administrative capacity of the bank in order to be able to accomplish all the new tasks
we emphasise dialogue with stakeholders and better alignment with the political goals of the % european union ] in the respective regions and the rapporteur hopes that the ` eib ] will continue to work successfully outside the % eu ] as a top rated bank and as an % eu ] institution
that is a very efficient use of scarce % eu ] resources the rapporteur also thanks the council in particular the ) lithuanian ] presidency with which he has negotiated for accepting to use external assigned revenues from the fiduciary account established for the facility for euro mediterranean investment and partnership to finance the
! two billion ] might not sound very much but if we consider what these funds can mobilise overall it is very significant
we had worries that it might take longer but it is now in place this will give the ` european investment bank ] the possibility to continue its operations without disruption which is of course extremely important
the rapporteur is also very satisfied with the open and constructive work he has had with civil society during the work on of this report ngos were particularly helpful regarding transparency and on social and environmental aspects etc
from the agreement reached it is however clear that the decision to use reflows in this way is a one off deal and cannot be used as a precedent in other contexts
the use of % eu ] funds through the ` eib ] allows for a leverage effect of more funding sometimes up to ! twenty five ] times the amount we invest
the rapporteur also very much welcomes the agreement to keep the lending ceilings at current levels
we also emphasise increased transparency monitoring of the bank 's activities democratic scrutiny and zero tolerance of tax evasion and fraud as being crucial
in accordance with the treaty the ` eib ] should endeavour to support the objectives of the % union ] 's development cooperation policy such as by reducing poverty through inclusive growth and sustainable economy and environmental and social development
financial agreements with individual promoters relating to ` eib ] operations should also include appropriate environmental social human rights and labour provisions
the ` eib ] should also support investment projects in sustainable energy security and energy infrastructure including transmission infrastructure in particular interconnections that facilitate the integration of electricity from renewable sources
~ first ] of all thanks to the commissioner because what he said on the external mandate makes it possible for me to be much shorter i completely agree with his arguments when it comes to investments outside * europe ]
just think is it good or bad for * europe ] to have a more stable environment in % ukraine ] in * north africa ] etc
course it is good for * europe ]
if we do not do it for humanitarian reasons or solidarity reasons we should do it anyway for economic reasons because they would be stable partners for us in trade and investments etc
that would also be important for the future to enhance credibility in those instruments
finally my ~ third ] point
it has been said now when the financial framework and the % eu ] budget has been cut let us put more emphasis on these instruments yes but they cannot really replace the budget instruments
they are always a complement
north ) african ] countries of course are not eligible to be members at least under present rules but their receipt of investment is a sign that the % eu ] is not so much a ) european ] union as a global union in waiting
there will undoubtedly be people in the still crisis ridden states of the south who wonder why all such available money is not being invested there
the answer might be that investment will be less effective in those countries when expansion is constrained by a currency that is overvalued for their economies
it is clear at the moment that all ! twenty eight ] are not committed to the same level of implementation of the existing regulation i hope that will change with the new regulation
yet as we have heard in this debate our member states and companies continue to provide the very tools that facilitate such harassment to the very governments that undertake such repression
it is unacceptable to hide behind the shield of privacy in this area
mr president the % eu ] rightly and regularly condemns state intimidation and violence against journalists dissidents and human rights defenders
as is ensuring uniform implementation of the regulation throughout all of our member states
~ firstly ] the parameters of human security controls must be carefully calibrated so that they do not hinder the development of the % eu ] cybersecurity industry nor the trade in cybersurveillance technologies that are essential to protect us against criminals and terrorists
it is illustrating that the process is moving forward thanks to members determination
indeed a defining feature of export control is it is based on case by case assessments and that is why we believe that controls must be targeted and take into account the precise circumstances of a particular export
autonomous weapon systems artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing will shape our world in years to come not only in the civilian area but also in the military sphere
i would also like to welcome this interim report because it shows the strong convergence of views between the ` european parliament ] and the commission in particular the introduction of a human security dimension that explicitly incorporate human rights into export controls reflects our commitment to a true value based trade policy
last but not least it is our joint responsibility to wield trade tools to effectively protect security and human rights and the starting point for this is to make the correct analysis of the threat landscape
it is no coincidence that the # wannacry ] cyberattacks of @ two thousand and seven ] were attributed to % north korea ] the same malicious actor that puts international peace and stability and security at risk by developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in contradiction of ` united nations ] security resolutions and commits terrorist attacks in foreign countries using chemical nerve agents
this illustrates the convergence of security threats from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to cyberproliferation and terrorism
the proposed general export authorisation is an important step in that direction but i agree that we should identify efforts to find the right balance between security and trade in encryption products
technology is global economy and trade are global security is global and proliferators do not care about borders or our regulations so we must take into account that reality while maintaining control firmly within % eu ] jurisdiction where we can act to strengthen them
@ one year ] after the proposal from the commission the adoption of this report by an overwhelming majority sends a very strong political signal
cyberthreats increasingly threaten countries businesses and citizens in the % eu ] and across the world and we must take action and when and where necessary autonomous % eu ] action to ensure that this trade does not fuel conflict and human right violations we have heard your message on encryption and we share the concerns that trade in advanced it products that contain encryption should not be unduly restricted at a time when we are racing towards the internet of things
the ` inta ] report cautions against socalled extraterritorial controls and in this respect we must not forget that the overarching objective of the proposal is to adjust % eu ] policy to rapidly changing technology economic and security conditions
so that is why we need to have a proposal that is capable of continuously adjusting to a constantly changing security technological and economic environment and we need as you so rightly say in your report to make the system future proof
i would also like to point out that there are obvious links between different facets of the threat environment
so we must respond to the risk of sensitive items falling into the hands of non state actors and in particular terrorists and ensure that controls contribute to preventing terrorism
that is why we consider that % eu ] control should not be limited in principle to cybersurveillance technology but should be ready to address other emerging technologies of concern
the broadening of the threat landscape today does not only concern cybersecurity
the subject we are discussing @ today ] is a true example of valuebased trade
a few issues that require further attention
i understand that the ` council ] is also actively proceeding with its examination and i hope that the mandate for trilogues will be ready by the end of the } bulgarian ] presidency
we take our responsibility to scrutinise policy proposals carefully but it also shows that we are serious that our rhetoric about valuesbased trade becomes our practice
this is what our citizens expect from us namely that we take human rights very seriously in this kind of trade
we are introducing a new % eu ] general export authorisation simplifying controls on intra % eu ] transfer on sensitive products and technologies we are developing an electronic licensing system in member states and we are facilitating technology transfers
it is indeed high time that we adapt to changing technologies and emerging security threats and this is what we are trying to do with this
i am happy to see that there is such a great consensus in this house maybe the christmas spirit is still looming but i think it is mostly thanks to the rapporteur and his work that we have such strong support for this report
it will definitely facilitate discussions with the next institution and hopefully we will have flexible legislation that is able to adjust to technologies and security
mr president the ( billion euro ] commercial market in ready made surveillance systems remains largely unregulated and that is astonishing in light of the capabilities that companies in surveillance hacking and exfiltration technologies are further and further developing
while many politicians claim to be concerned with cyber security anyone who can afford it can buy systems that collect massive amounts of data can break into people 's devices without the consent of the user and information can be removed unnoticed
the digital surveillance market should worry us in * europe ] but the consequences of exports to dictatorships where the rule of law is absent is even more grave and unacceptable
the ) arab ] uprisings @ seven years ago ] were often associated with the use of technology to advance human rights but it has become crystal clear how repressive regimes have mastered technologies for their own goals and control and this is not limited to the * middle east ]
human rights defenders journalists critical citizens dissidents and representatives of civil society are targets worldwide
it has taken a long time for there to be % eu ] action but i 'm very glad that we found broad consensus to update the dual use regulation that will tackle this toxic trade with targeted measures on the basis of human security
surveillance systems will require a licence before export human rights will become a clear criterion to assess before a licence is granted and definitions will be clear so the private sector will not suffer or be hindered unnecessarily and we in turn count on their cooperation
we need to end the notion of so called licence shopping where a company maybe rejected a licence in for example the % netherlands ] but can be granted ! one ] in for example % italy ]
at the same time and i am glad the commissioner mentioned it security researchers should be able to do their job which sometimes requires coordinated attacks on systems precisely to make them more resilient and robust
an encryption which actually helps people to protect data doesn 't belong on a controls list
we call for the lifting of export controls on that
i look forward to a swift trilogue that can start under the ) bulgarian ] presidency without delay
it is good to see such a coming together of minds between our ! three ] institutions which can have a real impact in the real world
there are ! four hundred and fifty ] ! zero ] successions @ per year ] which have an international background
at any rate even if we decide on this without the participation of the % uk ] and % ireland ] they will of course always have the possibility of opting in later
that is what we should do in order to allow citizens to exercise their right to free movement
the future regulation which is now on the table already constitutes a fair compromise which the % uk ] and % ireland ] should be able to accept because there are substantial benefits in it for their citizens
i think it is very important that notaries in all the participating member states will be informed and will inform their clients about the new possibilities available to them
i am sure this is ! one ] of the points we can put on the table during the # european year of citizens ] in order to show that yes we care for citizens
i absolutely agree with the rapporteur that the text which has been under discussion for such a long time has been very much improved thanks to the arduous work of the rapporteur and the committee
i am very much aware that succession is a delicate sensitive area which is intrinsically linked to national policies on family protection and judicial systems and that there are considerable differences between the national laws but fortunately we have had a wonderful rapporteur mr } lechner ]
this is not just for a few people because around ! ten ] of the total number of successions in the % eu ] involve an international dimension
i think mr } lechner ] with this action you have left a stamp on the ` european parliament ] and i think we can all thank you for the work you have done in the interests of the citizens of % europe ]
mr president believe me i am very glad to see that this proposal is on the agenda of this plenary sitting because citizens have been waiting for a long time for too long
the resolution which is for adoption @ tomorrow ] maintains the main policy objectives set for the commission namely that successions will be governed by ! one ] single law that of the country of habitual residence of the deceased
people will be able to plan their succession in advance by choosing the law of their country of nationality wherever they move in the % european union ] and there will be free movement of court decisions and of authentic instruments in * europe ]
the value is about ( eur one hundred and twenty billion ] so this regulation provides a unique opportunity to show that * europe ] is taking action to make life easer for citizens in difficult human and legal situations
the cherry on the cake is of course the & european certificate of succession ] which will enable people to prove their status as heirs and exercise their rights throughout the % eu ]
he is going to be missed
can i start off by saying ~ first ] of all my very sincere thanks to our colleague mr } lechner ] for the tremendous amount of hard work that he has put into this dossier over a period of about @ two years ] or so
this was ! one ] of the issues i wanted to discuss with him
i note that there remain concerns within delegations in the ` council ] regarding other aspects of the regulation such as the provisions relating to administration
! three one ] of the % uk ] population comes from another % eu ] member state and i consider that the failure to resolve the issue of clawback is a fundamental flaw in the final regulation as it will close off its benefits to a huge number of citizens from other member states who happen to be living in the % uk ] and % ireland ] and conversely the large numbers of expat % uk ]
can i also express my real disappointment at the decision in the ` council ] whereby the % uk ] and % ireland ] found themselves in a position where they did not feel they were able to opt into this regulation
practices vary widely across the % european union ] in this area and we must consider whether the final article agreed between ` parliament ] and ` council ] will meet the needs of citizens and practitioners from all member states
i thank him for everything he has done in making sure that he has made his contribution and i wish him well for whatever he chooses to do after he leaves us
for instance more than ! fifteen ] of successions that have been carried out in the % united kingdom ] had a cross border element
the danger is that it will lead to an % eu ] law of property ownership
an % eu ] certificate of succession is a short step away from a ) european ] probate registry and the introduction of an % eu ] property tax
now i doubt that many people in % england ] realise that we are debating the % eu ] 's intention to take control of inheritance law
the ! one ] good thing i can say about this is that the ) british ] government has exercised its opt out
anyway some meps might like to consider the wisdom of handing yet more control to the % eu ] in this area and vote with meps from the ` uk independence party ] against it
there will be differences because countries are located differently geographically
i was very happy about the eurema scheme in % malta ]
therefore we will always have to be prepared for some sort of solidarity mechanism or some sort of assistance
we could identify that and mobilise a whole range of tools to alleviate the pressure
there are histories in different member states there is the reputation issue
i think we could achieve the same goals by setting up this forum with the commission together with ` easo ] and other experts giving regular reports convening the forum and identifying where the needs are the biggest and hopefully member states could pledge the places in order to help and show solidarity we have set aside specific lump sums for that in order to provide also the economic possibilities for solidarity and together with the experience the know how and the best practices which we have gained from eurema i think this could be almost as good as a permanent legislative
it was very difficult to get member states to pledge places very difficult and as you saw only ! fourteen ] people have been relocated through that scheme when as i told you we discussed with the ministers the possibility of setting up a scheme such as you are asking for a legislative permanent scheme only a couple of member states were in favour but a vast majority were totally against there is not the political climate today to make it possible to propose such a scheme
but again there will always be some sort of mechanism
of course in the medium term this will mean that we can distribute the responsibility a little better in the % european union ] and that we can help more people however there will always be differences between the member states
it will take some time before it works in all member states but it will mean that all member states will have the possibility of receiving asylum seekers in a fair transparent and humane way
as the commissioner very honestly said we cannot have such a scheme if the ` council ] sets its face against a permanent legislative solution
we are here @ today ] with the oral question for the simple reason that the member states are not providing the solidarity which we in this house wish to see
we now all have to work to see whether these kinds of solutions are something we can work with when the member states will not help us by coming up with a permanent legislative proposal
however today it is clear that economic and political enlargement of * europe ] is not enough to have * europe ] truly integrated as a community of values we need a new wave of enlargement that of * europe ] 's conscience
the new % eu ] survey of water quality in % ireland ] indicates that almost ! two thirds ] of people say water quality is a serious problem while ! half ] consider that the quality has deteriorated since
! fifty ] so ageing issues are not just something that are of interest to people in here but are of interest to people right outside amongst our constituents
can i please underpin the comments already made by a few colleagues about the importance of intergroups
i am co president of the ` intergroup on ageing ] and as you may be aware over ! fifty ] of voters @ this year ] for the very ~ first ] time will be over ! fifty ] as opposed to under
i would plead with you mr president to use the qualities of clarity and fairness which are the hallmarks of your presidency to make sure that the work of intergroups can be facilitated and not hindered from here on have we got your promise please
despite the valuable work of intergroups they have been marginalised over @ the last year ] and effectively they are being shut down by in house parliamentary rules that refuse intergroups meeting rooms and slots in the schedule of the % strasbourg ] sitting
` parliament ] will be much poorer for their extinction and the people of * europe ] will not be as well served
in intergroups meps can unite across the political divide to deal with particular issues
for example the oldest intergroup the one on disabilities vets legislation that goes through this ` parliament ] to be sure that it is disability friendly and educates other parliamentarians about disability issues
i think we need to sort this out quite urgently before the next term because otherwise intergroups will be a thing of the past
mr president it is more than @ a month ] since you visited * gaza ] but the latest figures from the ) israeli ] government show that nothing has changed still no materials for reconstruction are being allowed through the checkpoints
no material for schools no material for industry
perhaps this would be a good time for this ` parliament ] to try and influence opinion by hosting an exhibition of the t shirts to which reference has been made by another member clothing produced to the design of soldiers such as the sniper from the ` givati brigade ] whose design incorporates a pregnant ) palestinian ] woman and the slogan ! one ] shot ! two ] kills
there are other reports in ) israeli ] newspapers of other designs that are more racist more extreme more vile
such an exhibition might encourage members to question whether or not we should be continuing with the & eu israel association agreement ] in the present circumstances
@ last week ] the issue was discussed by ministers under the ) irish ] presidency
lending taxpayers money without judging solely upon their economic viability is folly of the ~ first ] order
and let me remind you that the ` eib ] lent almost ( eur eighty billion ] @ last year ] in order that the % eu ] can broaden and deepen its control
the ~ second ] proposal is to increase the budget for external lending
and astonishingly the ` committee on budgetary control ] stated that the soundness of funded projects should not be assessed only in terms of economic relevance confirming both the political nature of the ` eib ] and that the % eu ] does not have a grip on the realities of the market
well neither is justifiable given the ` eib ] 's performance to date
i think it is a question of credibility also of the financial institutions that we do not forget what we subscribed to in % new york ] @ two years ago ] and in % paris ] @ one and a half years ago ] the ` eib ] is in the vanguard in this respect among the financial institutions
i think we can be better on cohesion in @ the next couple of years ]
madam president this was such a wide spectrum of interventions and opinions and issues that i certainly cannot respond to each and every one of them in the very limited time so i promise to every member of the ` european parliament ] who has posed a question or made a remark that we will come back individually to those issues which i cannot
i agree with that as well
we have lots of experience with microcredit outside the % european union ] and i think it is gaining in importance within it as well i have heard well that you encourage us to take more risk
there is ! one ] big issue that has been the focus of the discussions in % washington ] last weekend and that is climate change and sustainability and i can tell you that the wind is not necessarily getting any more favourable to these issues
finally i know that questions of accountability are always of utmost importance and so are questions of transparency
i think a couple of issues are really of key importance for me now because i heard the words focus and coordination again and again and i can report to you that in the context of the economic resilience initiative for the * southern neighbourhood ] and the * western balkans ] in connection then with the external investment plan of the % european union ] and the ` g twenty ] initiative on * africa ]
~ second ] point i thank you very much for your remarks on the external activities of the ` european investment bank ]
but we are also the biggest multilateral borrower in the world because we refinance by going to the capital markets for ( eur seventy one hundred billion ] per year through the sale of ` eib ] bonds so we have an accumulated debt also of more than ( eur half a trillion ] and that means we have to be very serious when we talk about sustainability
! one ] % malta ] % bulgaria ] % cyprus ] % croatia ] % poland ] % slovakia ] % finland ] % portugal ] % spain ] % greece ] % italy ] % lithuania ] these are the ~ first ] countries on that list and i think that reflects the needs and the fact that probably roughly ! three ] times as much per capita goes into a country like % spain ] and that in comparison to my own country shows that the % european union ] and the ` european investment bank ] are aware of our special responsibilities vis vis those countries which are either relatively new in the % union ] or are in difficulties and % spain ] is a wonderful example where the ` eib ] could make a substantial contribution
so investments per gdp % estonia ]
however i want to get away from the impression that comes back in reports and questions again and again that we so to speak favour the old big strong member states of the ) european ] to the detriment of the small ones i shall read out the ` eib ] 's @ two thousand and sixteen ] signatures as a percentage of gdp and i shall just mention the list in the order of magnitude
it is very evident that more and better coordination is absolutely urgent if we do not want to confuse our partners in the political and economic world
it is only roughly ! ten ] of what we are doing but it is gaining importance because it becomes more and more evident that the % european union ] is sometimes serving its interests best if it looks beyond its own borders and takes activities outside the % union ] and the % eu ] bank is ready to support that i believe in the future there will be more
that is a principle that goes beyond economics of course but also when it comes to the principle of economic viability and the concentration of social and environmental standards which we observe closely
this is a cultural issue for a bank which invests but it must not be overlooked that this bank is capital market based
i fully share that
to a thorough improvement of the situation and we are proud of that
there is ! one ] big issue within the % european union ] that we have to address and we will address it now with the % new york ] regulation for efsi ii and that is cohesion
i think it has been a mistake in the original legislation and you have something to do with that legislation by the way for efsi because the combination of the esif and efsi was very difficult in the old regulation and with the new one that is now on your desks i think this will get better
it is necessary for the ` eib ] to systematically pay attention to mid and longterm effects when defining investment actions and its funding decisions and to investing in projects of systematic importance in the long term
should act so as not to complicate the criteria and the rules
madam president commissioner president } hoyer ] we are discussing the report on the annual report of the ` eib ] for @ two thousand and fifteen ] and let me say from the outset that this has been another successful year for the ` european investment bank ] in my opinion the bank has been particularly successful and efficient in ! two ] areas
the ~ second ] area is microfinance which indeed with limited funds has been able to sustain a large number of jobs in the % european union ] the focus of our report here in this discussion is how to increase investment because investment is something which is very much needed in * europe ]
however i would invite you to consider whether enough practical steps have been taken to better manage cohesion objectives because it is not only a question of better reporting but of very carefully looking into the way of actually interacting with the commission if you like to devise the proper policy responses
regarding cohesion i have received information which recognises that the ! thirty ] horizontal goal for cohesion investments has not been reached over the @ past two years ]
! one ] issue that you mentioned at the beginning of your intervention > this morning ] president } hoyer ] has to do with the continuing significant differences as to regional gaps having to do with the investment gap and this clearly is a central challenge for the % union ] as such
so we come to the subject of cohesion and i have raised this issue in previous partsessions
since we face the existential over arching challenge of increasing divergences
in this regard i would like to express my appreciation for the information which you mentioned also coming from the bank on issues raised in previous sessions
substantive ongoing relationship with ` parliament ]
makes the point that there should be a revision of the makeup of the vicepresidents because they come from only some of the member states
in this regard i would like to draw attention to ! two ] paragraphs in mr } ali ] 's report paragraphs ! seventy five ] and ! seventy six ] one deals with the concerns of the european ombudsman about the shortcomings in mechanisms to prevent possible conflicts of interest in the ` eib ] and the other
in @ two thousand and sixteen ] it was lower but we know that ! two ] big gas pipeline projects are pending to the value of ( eur three billion ]
if we then look at the lending of the ` eib ] there is still a lot of fossil fuel lending in @ two thousand and thirteen ] at the level of ( eur two billion ]
if we want to achieve ! zero ] emissions by @ halftime this century ] then any investment in fossil fuel infrastructure should be considered very very very carefully
that is big expenditure and the issue is that investments in those infrastructures are there for @ decades ]
it is not a transition
i suggested that an in specie distribution of some of the bank 's % uk ] loan book into a % uk ] sovereign fund might be an idea
the ` eib ] is propping up economies which are structurally unsound as a result of their membership of the euro in % greece ] the ` eib ] has invested ten of ) greek ] gdp but worse this report suggests the ` eib ] should call for even more capital and demand even more from the ) british ] taxpayer
the existing contingent joint and several liabilities run to the order of some ( eur five hundred billion ]
that 's a worrying sum when one considers the political motivations behind it
talking of innovative instruments and in view of the forthcoming parliamentary reports on efsi implementation and efsi
i sometimes still read statistics from the very ~ first ] beginning of the efsi implementation which show a different direction but nowadays it can be clearly said that efsi projects are particularly where efsi projects are needed most and we are very proud of that
the external lending mandate of the ` ecb ]
this facility will enable ) greek ] banks to provide trade and export finance services to ) greek ] smes and mid cap companies at a time when no commercial lines with private banks are available through this facility the ` eib ] acts as a secure bridge between international and domestic banks supporting trade and export finance and therefore having a direct concrete impact on the business of
i can assure you that we put very strong emphasis on being a leading financial institution when it comes to issues such as due diligence compliance good governance transparency and accountability
consequently we vest our hopes in the ongoing revision of the & financial regulation ] and ! fifteen ] sectoral legislative acts the so called & omnibus ] which aims inter alia at simplifying and streamlining the implementation of financial instruments and budgetary guarantees
over ! four ] ! zero ] smes are to benefit from enhanced access to finance thanks to efsi support and we have already approved ! twenty two ] investment platforms most of them being the result of a very fruitful cooperation with national promotional banks
% eu ] the central role we play in efsi does not mean that we retreat from the rest of the world
let me therefore conclude by assuring you that the ` eib ] stands ready to live up to its institutional responsibilities both operationally and in terms of reporting and we welcome our regular exchange with this ` parliament ] on our activities and their impact on the ground
i am particularly proud that the ` eu bank ] continues to be the world leader in climate related finance as well as of the effect our financing has on young people
they are only selected if they would not have been financed by the ` eib ] group in the same period or to the same extent without ` efsi ] support as specified in the & efsi regulation ]
we are very grateful for the open and cooperative attitude of ` parliament ] on this issue especially for ensuring that sufficient resources are attributed to this instrument which will allow the ` eu bank ] to continue its global level activities on behalf of the % union ]
in preparation for this plenary debate we also sent a state of play on the recommendations tabled in the previous report to the rapporteur mr } pirinski ] the respective committee secretariats and the meps who were closely involved in the drafting process
i am firmly convinced that this calls for a further use of financial instruments
as a matter of fact it has changed our dna
@ in recent years ] the world has become more integrated and more challenging than ever before
the reports we are discussing today suggests that this oversight consists of a more structured exchange and although in principle i have no objection to discussing the idea i believe we must discuss how future arrangements might work
i am aware that additionality as we have just heard is central to efsi and that we need to do more to communicate and demonstrate it better based on concrete examples of projects
the ` eib ] 's external lending mandate is indisputably the most effective and efficient % eu ] financing instrument and a powerful multiplier of % eu ] external action
efsi has been a success so far
there were also numerous hearings with other members of the bank 's management committee and services
@ two weeks ago ] we activated the trade fund facility
in relation to the ` eib ] 's economic resilience initiative which comes on top of our normal lending to * africa ] and the neighbouring countries a brief reference to let you know is that this is already there on the ground and is delivering results
i strongly support what commissioner } moscovici ] has just said about the need to continue our engaged work in the fight against youth unemployment
i insist on the wording the real economy because this is where we work
in addition public funding and traditional instruments such as grants will not be able to solve all the existing and new challenges * europe ] faces
@ two thousand and fifteen ] investment is recovering in the % european union ] but large differences in regional and sectoral investment performance remain and we need additional initiatives and projects in order to address this investment gap
sound public and private long term investments as well as the acknowledgment of the bank 's important role outside the % european union ]
taking into consideration the current political and economic climate it is unlikely that in the future we will have more or even the same amount of resources available not only to support investment but in fact for % eu ] priorities in general
but issues raised in the reports are also relevant for the future so if you agree i will not limit myself only to
we must therefore find intelligent ways to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of available public resources namely by crowding in private investors and making full use of the capacity of financial institutions consequently leveraging public money and making more funds available for the real economy
! two ] ! zero ] i would like to take the opportunity to mention efsi and how it can finance investment trigger growth and the creation of jobs
allow me to give you another concrete example where our innovative and financing products make an impact in this case in a country hit by the financial crisis
overlaps should be avoided and coordination should be demonstrated
to date we can be proud that almost ( eur one hundred and eighty four billion ] in total investments have been mobilised that is to say ! fifty eight ] of efsi 's initial target of ( eur three hundred and fifteen billion ]
we are ready to even expand our close cooperation with the ` european parliament ]
the ` eib ] group as the % eu ] 's bank stands ready to identify the areas where financial instruments can complement and probably release % eu ] grants and to continue to implement such instruments for the benefit of the entire % eu ]
! two ] out of ! three ] promoters of projects which benefit from efsi are new clients to the bank and this clearly demonstrates how much efsi has changed the ` eib ] group
those external challenges and the % eu ] 's objectives beyond its borders are best met through a stronger and more integrated % eu ] response ensured by enhanced coordination and joint action between the ` european commission ] the member states and the ` eu bank ]
! four ] ! four million ] jobs in smes which is where most young people find work and since its launch in @ two thousand and thirteen ] the ` eib ] 's skills and jobs investing for youth programme has provided more than ( eur thirty seven billion ] towards projects that support jobs and better skills for young people
eligible projects rest on market failures or sub optimal investment situations
its guarantee fund and portfolio structure allow the ` eu bank ] to support investment of around ! thirty ] to ! forty ] times the % eu ] budget demand provisions for the guarantee thereby delivering concrete results and impact in ~ third ] countries at minimal cost to the % eu ] budget
to give you ! one ] concrete example once adopted the omnibus will facilitate the essential combination of efsi with ) european ] structural and investment funds which might simultaneously improve the absorption of esi funds and bring more efsi financing to some countries as highlighted in the reports the ` eib ] 's activities have contributed to sustainable growth and employment in * europe ] and to stability in our neighbourhood
let me emphasise that in quantitative terms efsi is not business as usual for the ` eib ]
on the contrary out of the ( eur eighty four billion ] of ` eib ] group financing in @ two thousand and fifteen ] over ( eur eight billion ] went outside the % union ] directly contributing to the implementation of % eu ] policies and standards
thank you very much and i am looking forward to the debate
also looking to the future we should establish a clear complementarity and harmonisation of the different instruments that the % european union ] employs externally namely the external investment plan the commissioner just mentioned
smes and as such in the real economy
we are continuously in contact with other international financial institutions ngos and relevant authorities to ensure that we apply best banking practice
in any case i can assure you that we continue to work on this working with a regional and local focus to facilitate efsi support across the
the resilience initiative for countries affected by migration and even the ` g twenty ] initiative for * africa ]
madam president i tabled a number of amendments to this report on the basis that it was allowed to then be informed by the services that it was not allowed to then be informed again that it was allowed to then being finally informed yet again that no it would not be allowed the nature of the beast here now under the rules
my concerns are based in a number of areas
% ireland ] is a neutral country and we intend to stay so i was also worried that in the area of new investments and especially in pps and in securitisation the ` european investment bank ] ` eib ] is not guarding against the added risks of socialising losses while privatising profits
i wanted cast iron guarantees against conflicts of interest especially in the area of disbarment policy where the ` eib ] falls well short of the standards set by the ` world bank ]
on transparency also the ` eib ] falls well short of what i would like to see
madam president for the ` european investment bank ] to be able to perform its mandate successfully it needs guidance and control from the % eu ] budgetary authorities
we have to aim to provide the ` eib ] with the best solutions to achieve its policy objectives to accelerate innovation and economic recovery and to promote employment social economic and environmental sustainability
we want the ` eib ] to stand on firm and strong financial ground
the ` eib ] should have a strong mandate with a strong investment portfolio especially in the framework of the european fund for strategic investments
while the ` eib ] should be mostly independent in its expertise to select the most appropriate beneficiaries it also has to follow strict rules and guidelines monitored by the budgetary authority and the public in general
there is always room for improvement and we hope that the relations between the ` european parliament ] and the ` eib ] will further deepen to ensure the strong mandate and effective activity of the investment bank
enhancing the monitoring of the ` eib ] 's performance would be an important step towards a more accountable and effective investment bank
therefore the ` alde group ] decided to vote against this report because we need to have an actual and more effective way of dealing with reports like this
it is vitally important that these funds are properly and efficiently spent and accounted for
it is also important to address the issue of compensating for and replacing lost energy capacity
it was certainly not on safety grounds
we are now paying for mistaken judgments within the % european union ] institutions it is only right therefore that % bulgaria ] should be treated at least as well by the % european union ] as other countries that have had to close prematurely their ageing nuclear facilities and i am glad that the commission recognises this
the effect as predicted has been increased use of environmentally unfriendly lignite fuelled power stations an increase in electricity prices and a cut in % bulgaria ] 's electricity exports in other words both economic and environmental damage
a lot of money of course is involved in this decommissioning process
% bulgaria ] will need assistance in creating sustainable new capacity that ensures security of supply and diversification so that % bulgaria ] is not reliant on the goodwill of ! one ] foreign power
their closure @ several years ] ahead of time was not necessary
so far the commission has been quite dissatisfied with the information on decommissioning received from % bulgaria ]
this is why i believe that the ` european commission ] should first perform a specific evaluation to assess the strengths and weaknesses of past projects in order to improve funds programming together with the ` ebrd ] for the next funding period
i believe * europe ] has a responsibility to help and facilitate its decommissioning and we have to ensure that sufficient funding is made available to this project as this is crucial to keep safety up to high standards to ensure the necessary expertise and implement international best practices
this is why i fully support this proposal and our commitment to allocate an additional ( eur three hundred million ] to this project let me also remind you that the ` european parliament ] took a strong stance @ a few months ago ] on this dossier allocating the ~ first ] ( eur seventy five million ] in the @ two thousand and ten ] budget
nevertheless i think we should be intransigent regarding transparency in the use of ) european ] funds
according to international experts the plant does not have any protective cover and there are major risks of radioactive leakages into the soil and the water table
in the face of the unacceptable violent repression unfolding in % syria ] the commission has reacted swiftly and was the ~ first ] % european union ] donor to suspend its bilateral cooperation with the ) syrian ] authorities on @ twenty five may ]
the ) european ] instrument for democracy and human rights allows confidential emergency support to human rights defenders as well as support for the documentation of human rights violations digital security media and networking of activists
in parallel the commission is currently working with the ` european investment bank ] on the suspension of its technical assistance to the ` eib ] loan operations provided through the facility for euro mediterranean investment and partnership support fund
the national indicative programme for the years @ two thousand and eleven ] @ two thousand and thirteen ] was also suspended in fact it has lost its relevance given the lack of will on the ) syrian ] side to further implement reforms
it should be stressed that the commission is not losing sight of % syria ]
due to major operational constraints and the most recent political developments the commission is working jointly with the ` european external action service ] on clear instructions regarding the participation of % syria ] in regional programmes
there are considerable risks in engaging with civil society within % syria ] under the current circumstances especially for potential beneficiaries and the commission is cautiously preparing any new activity in light of the do no harm principle we are exploring ideas for supporting
the suspension was for the ~ first ] time in the region based on the human rights violations committed by the ) syrian ] regime
it is clear that the commission does not envisage further cooperation with the ) syrian ] authorities at the moment
for civil society and human rights defenders
this participation will be thoroughly assessed on a case by case basis
however the commission has not suspended all its activities in % syria ] the projects directly benefiting the ) palestinian ] and ) iraqi ] refugees are ongoing and will continue
we also fully support the resolution of the ` un human rights council ] of @ twenty three august two thousand and eleven ] which demanded that an international independent commission should be dispatched to % syria ] to investigate the human rights violations in % syria ] which may amount to crimes against humanity
and especially to be governed by those whose hands are stained with their blood the more people are killed the more it becomes apparent that the regime has crossed the * rubicon ]
one wonders how % russia ] and % china ] can remain passive towards these cold blooded massive assassinations
this is an intolerable situation for how long will the international community continue to be a spectator to such bloodshed
the % eu ] the ` council ] and high representative have correctly widened sanctions and used strict language of condemnation but the time has come to toughen our approach towards % russia ] and % china ] as ) french ] foreign minister } alain jupp ] has done
shame on the ` security council ] for not being able until now to agree on a resolution contenting themselves with a mere statement
it is also shameful to me that it took @ five months ] for the ` arab league ] to undertake an initiative and although details are unknown i doubt if the ) syrian ] people would be able to accept any arrangement falling short of their legitimate aspirations
the acts of the ) syrian ] regime remind me of the ) iranian ] regime 's acts and we have strong reasons to believe that they are providing tools and know how but we must not allow the same to happen as in % iran ] in @ two thousand and nine ] for the people to be further crushed and oxygen freedom and opportunity for a brighter future to be squeezed out of society even more
i can only hope that her absence does not reflect the broader absence of the % eu ] and the ` eas ] on the ground at this crucial moment in time but i am worried that it does
i sincerely hope that the ) polish ] presidency will use this momentum of an all time low to revive and strengthen * europe ] in the world
we must also explicitly force the economic elites who are in } al assad ] 's camp to make a choice
the % eu ] must liaise much more intensely with candidate member state % turkey ] to act sensibly towards % syria ] while we welcome the shelter provided for refugees i want to highlight that it is regrettable that prime minister } erdogan ] did not mention % syria ] at the # arab league ] in % cairo ] @ yesterday ]
meanwhile the % eu ] is not leveraging its weight
in % syria ] snipers are shooting people for holding a cell phone children are tortured to death the government is turning off water electricity food and medicine supplies to entire cities censorship and misinformation are rampant and cell phone networks and internet are down
} ghayath mattar ] a human rights defender and activist for a peaceful transition in % syria ] was tortured to death @ this week ]
people are slaughtered and buried in mass graves while the families are forced to state that these murders were the work of so called thugs
let us not forget that the number of ! two ] ! six hundred ] estimated deaths refers to a father a mother a brother a sister a friend a spouse or a child each and every time
speaking out peacefully for justice rights opportunities and self determination
as % syria ] 's most significant trade partner now is the time to impose further targeted sanctions
doing business with the % eu ] means breaking with } al assad ] and } al assad ] must be held accountable for his deeds
the high representative very kindly then wrote to me on @ twenty six july ]
finally i simply say this
i ask you what exactly are those measures in relation to online activists
i found him to be a most charming man who directly to our delegation promised reform
he is not going to deliver
it is quite clear that without normal media outlets in operation online activists are the only lifeline that people in % syria ] have @ today ] to let the world know what is happening
it then moves on to a ~ second ] stage which is to arrest those activists who persist and then force those activists to pass over their usernames and passwords they do that through the use of torture including food and sleep deprivation fingernail extraction electric shocks stripping naked and flogging and sexual abuse of female detainees by male security officers on @ six july ] i attended this plenary debate and i wanted concentration on these issues
he has not delivered
he must go immediately
what are we doing
i have previously when we debated % syria ] wanted to concentrate on the role played by online activists and i want to explore that further
in the letter she states and i quote despite the constraints of an environment which is so controlled by the government the % eu ] is developing practical actions to support the civil society and human rights defenders in % syria ] and beyond
the } syrian ] people have demonstrated that things must change and face a terrible risk but the current regime will not listen
we call on president } bashar al assad ] to relinquish power immediately and we reject impunity for all those responsible for the gross violation of human rights
he like so many others defied the security forces and paid the ultimate price
just @ today ] i have been in touch with opposition contacts who inform me that there have been further protests in the city of % homs ] and in % hama ] but also sadly state that the crackdown by government forces continues and that the death toll is rising
i am sure you will share my disgust at reports filtering out of the country today that ) syrian ] security forces attacked the gathering of mourners at his very funeral we have just finished a debate on % libya ] of course we should call for the ` un human rights council ] to have a fact finding mission immediately to the country but we should follow the model of % libya ] and call for referral to the ` international criminal court ]
i would like to see a democratic reform of % syria ] but we must not presume that all of } al assad ] 's opponents are democrats
they include hardline ) islamists ] such as the ` muslim brotherhood ] who would replace a repressive secular state with a repressive theocratic state
in this perspective we can have no doubt that our clear position on the ) syrian ] regime is right and needs to be maintained
we must make it clear that we are targeting our sanctions so that we can ultimately achieve a halt to the violence and assist the ) syrian ] people to accomplish their legitimate aspirations
we need to repeat time and again that there must be a peaceful political transition to democracy led and owned by the whole ) syrian ] people and free from violence
we have swiftly broadened our restrictive measures and are progressively targeting with asset freezes and travel bans more and more of those responsible for the ongoing repression and from now on those supporting the regime
one cannot but recognise that so far these attempts have not been successful but that must not prevent the % european union ] from maintaining close contact with those regional partners which could in a not too distant future play a significant role in the evolution of % syria ]
let me be very clear
importantly we have introduced an embargo on the import of ) syrian ] oil
we expect it will have a major impact on the regime 's financial situation since the % eu ] consumes more than ! ninety ] of the oil % syria ] exports
i am pleased to say that the % eu ] has been able to accompany its strong position with adequate actions
finally we must not forget about % syria ] 's future
rightly we ask questions about what comes next and what it will mean for the ) syrian ] people for the situation in the region and for others including ourselves we should do our best to know the alternatives and the different opposition groups whether abroad or inside % syria ]
it is time to encourage those who are capable of offering % syria ] a better future to unite and show political maturity and commitment to the values we share
it is essential for us to explain properly why we have taken all these actions against the ) syrian ] regime given the strength of our measures against the ) syrian ] regime we must be proactive and well coordinated in communicating with our partners and public opinion in % syria ] and elsewhere
the regime has not stopped its violent repression and nearly every day we hear reports of ) syrians ] being killed injured detained or abused
we must also reach out to the countries of the region which have increasingly expressed concern about the present situation in % syria ]
of course this is ironic given the fact that % damascus ] has given huge support to ` hamas ] and ` hezbollah ] in the past
% syria ] is not % libya ] and sadly } al assad ] knows that we cannot launch a similar right to protect ` nato ] military operation on the side of the rebels but we can state our revulsion at } assad ] 's brutality and we can apply stronger sanctions including selective bans on investment from ) european ] companies and oil import bans which are in place already and we can treat the illegitimate ) ba 'athist ] leadership as the pariahs that they really are
since this issue has been raised concerning % china ] and % russia ] i just want to stress and confirm that of course the ) syrian ] issue is raised in all meetings with those partners so there can be no doubt about our commitment to bringing all the international community on board
we have to act against the regime and in the interests of the people so it is essential that when we talk about sanctions we understand what effects those sanctions may have on the population i could referring to the number of arguments that were made give you a very long list of the sanctions we have imposed and yes i want to confirm that we are ready to go even further
but we all know that we have to measure those sanctions in such a way as not to harm the population but to make life difficult for the regime
i also want to emphasise once again the need for unity of the people and a strict message of non violence
of course this is not a very easy process
unlike on some other issues the % eu ] member states managed to come up with a single position on these sanctions and this should be applauded
at this moment in time more than ! one hundred and fifty ] countries are beneficiaries of the system
you could even ask yourself what the use of such a system is
as you know before you can make a legislative proposal you need a public consultation which takes time
the commission has heard ` parliament ] 's concerns on the decision making aspects of the & gsp ] regulation loud and clear
finally we are looking forward to further discussions with you on the future scheme of generalised preferences further to the proposal for a new regulation which will come your way in @ may ] i stand ready to discuss the main elements of the proposal at the earliest opportunity after it is adopted by the commission
for this reason the commission is committed to discussing in a constructive spirit ` parliament ] 's concern as expressed over @ the last few weeks ]
it also reinforces the % eu ] 's role and commitment to the objectives of % eu ] development policy
the period necessary to adjust to the entry into force of the & lisbon treaty ] and to submit a new regulation on the future % eu ] gsp scheme
whether one looks to the fight against terrorism counteracting cyber warfare or reacting to emerging security and humanitarian crises globally all of these are areas where the single member state today cannot always act effectively unilaterally
those who argue that this is a threat to national sovereignty in my country ignore the reality that this actually is by consensus and unanimity
if there were sanctions it might make people think a little bit more certainly this is an area which has to be a priority for us in the next legislature
you call for covering the status of public prosecutors and their autonomy
the @ two thousand and eighteen ] scoreboard expanded the coverage of money laundering and now shows for nearly all countries the length of court proceedings in money laundering cases
the two thousand and eighteen justice scoreboard was adopted by the commission @ today ]
it is important to remember that the scoreboard is a tool which is being continuously improved and your recommendations will be considered for the future as well
we have developed a measurement of perceived judicial independence among companies and the general public
these are indicators on how the needs of specific groups of users of justice systems for example children visually impaired people nonnative speakers are being taken into account in the provision of public information on the justice system in the training of judges and in surveys of court users
when considering any new area of coverage it is important to keep in mind the objective of the scoreboard and the ability to collect reliable data from all member states based on a simple and clear indicator in line with ) european ] standards
the eu justice scoreboard feeds into the european semester country analysis in this respect
having said all this it is important to recall that ! one ] of the key challenges for the development of information tools like the % eu ] justice scoreboard is the collection of data
with regard to judicial independence we are assessing the effectiveness of the national legal frameworks and safeguards in close cooperation with the judicial networks
we would like to thank ` parliament ] for having called on member states to cooperate with the commission
i am convinced that with your support the eu justice scoreboard will continue to evolve in order to further help the member states improve the independence quality and efficiency of their justice systems which is crucial for upholding the rule of law
i am glad that your report takes into account many of its elements
we share the same commitment and interest to strengthen the independence and effectiveness of judicial systems in our member states these are essential for economic development social peace and a secure * europe ]
it shows that while in about ! half ] of member states the ~ first ] instance court proceedings take @ up to a year ] on average these proceedings take @ around two years ] on average in several member states
i am pleased to say that the @ two thousand and eighteen ] scoreboard shows for the ~ first ] time an overview of how prosecution services are organised in member states
this report asks the commission to add collective redress procedures to @ next year ] 's comparative exercise because it is a major legal tool in strengthening consumer environmental and health protection in the % european union ]
i am very happy to see that the commission shares this view as it published a legislative proposal on this matter while we were working on this report
the legislative proposal by the commission on collective redress does not however make the call in this report redundant
on the contrary collective redress could provide efficient dispute resolution and the means to eliminate unreasonable barriers to access to justice in crossborder cases
the commission should also examine how the collective redress could be used in cases where companies or other organisations have committed or contributed to human rights violations in third countries outside ) european ] borders often due to legal technicalities or underdeveloped legislation there may be no effective ways for access to justice and remedy at all
this is a commission decision
it has to be said that the issue of the enforcement of ipr is only a part of the broader action of the commission on the modernisation of the ipr framework at % eu ] level
finally i would like to know if the purpose of this expert group is about to go in the same direction as that of the ` ohim observatory ] whose work programme for @ this year ] expressly includes the public domain and open licensing
he announced he would have the list of members of this expert group published along with all relevant documents including agendas and minutes of each meeting
the burden of proof is on the commission to show that this expert group will go beyond the ` ohim observatory ] and its rather extensive mandate if such an added benefit exists it would rather call for the readjustment of the ` eu observatory ] mandate
meeting documents of this ~ first ] meeting also remain unpublished
the commission should also comment on such a possible overlap and the apparent disconnect of this expert group from its predecessors also set up by the commission in previous years
so far no observer status has been given to members of this parliament but there are no procedural reasons not to as & article fifty three ] of the commission decision on setting up these expert groups allows the chair to assign observer status to every entity listed in & rule eight of the horizontal rules for commission expert groups ]
it is very important when developing measures for intellectual property enforcement to analyse how they affect creative works in the public domain or under a free licence model
that is why we would like to ask the commissioner to confirm that there will be no duplication of tasks between the observatory and the group of experts which the commission would like to establish according to the action plan on the enforcement of intellectual property rights and that
that given the importance of intellectual property rights for the future growth of the % european union ] we should use all our instruments in the most effective way in order to get the best information available
i think that the commission is of the same view and i would like to thank the commission for its quick reaction when providing us with its understanding of the issues raised in our question while drafting this question we have been motivated by the fact
i was really interested in your speech
would you agree that that is the main strength of this place
experts on the enforcement of intellectual property rights
let me turn to the specifics of your question
~ first ] you asked about the tasks of the group and how they add value to the work of the ` observatory ]
~ second ] you asked about the financial implications and whether there will be duplication
its members are the national authorities responsible for national ip policies and it is to exchange experience and good practice
it will not gather data or conduct studies itself
this is completely different as we see it from the role of the observatory
the ` observatory ] is there to facilitate and support the practical enforcement work
that includes improving understanding and raising awareness of the impact of ipr infringements providing training promoting enforcement tools and technology and helping national enforcement authorities to work together
the observatory supports national authorities the private sector and % eu ] institutions
part of this is data collection
the data collected and reported by the observatory supports the work of the commission and the member states
so the expert group focuses just to repeat on policy best practices and monitoring and the observatory focuses on the day to day enforcement and the collection of data
they do not duplicate
on the contrary they are complementary so the group will not result in unnecessary expenditure
~ third ] you wanted confirmation that you could send experts to an expert group meeting and the answer is yes absolutely you can you will be very welcome
we have to work together on ipr enforcement
it would be really helpful if you would follow the group actively
those who are in this business say that it is a constituent so how can we change something which in the nature of things indicates that pollen is a constituent
the error which i think some have committed with due respect is that ~ first ] they decide which kind of labelling and which kind of
so gm pollen needs to be authorised before this amendment of the directive and after the amendment
~ first ] of all the ` court of justice ] observed that there is no provision in the law which says whether pollen is an ingredient or a constituent
but it took this positivist approach that there is nothing in the law because had there been an indication a definition of pollen in the law as we are determining now it would have decided otherwise
if we consider pollen to be an ingredient then the
it does not guarantee it and indeed there is no legal instrument for guaranteeing that at all
many members here seem to have either forgotten or maybe to be deliberately ignoring the fact that as the commissioner said all foodstuffs have a gmo adventitious threshold of
determine the status of pollen as a constituent in honey
gm pollen in honey has to be authorised under our regulation applying to gm food and feed before it can be placed on the market
pollen is present in honey independently of the action of the beekeeper who has no control whatsoever over the presence of pollen in the final product
it is not an ingredient
i would like to congratulate her on the eloquent way in which she laid out the reasons why honey has pollen as a constituent
let me say a few words on the comitology alignment and stress that the commission proposes delegated acts to amend only those parts of the annexes which do not contain essential elements
to have a list reading ingredients honey pollen would obviously not be providing any additional information to the consumer and would only create an unnecessary labelling burden
products with ingredients need to have them listed on a label
it is technically impossible to produce honey free from pollen
honey is considered by producers and consumers alike to be the ultimate natural product made entirely by bees and free from human interference this includes the various constituents particular to honey such as pollen to define pollen as an ingredient would cause reputational damage to honey by implying that its production is not a wholly natural process
they will argue that they are doing this in the interest of consumers and to increase transparency about the gm content of food
lying to consumers by stating that pollen is an ingredient is not a good start
this is because according to the gm regulation only gm content above
of course as an active mep i have not let this proposal go unchallenged it is ` parliament ] 's job to investigate all aspects and come up with alternatives but in this case i have concluded that there is only one answer pollen is not an ingredient of honey
there has been a lot of scaremongering surrounding this proposal much of it designed to create uncertainty in the sector if the commission proposal is not adopted there will be negative consequences for the sector as all honey producers will be required to test their honey to check the gm content and some will be required to label if gm pollen is found to be present
to conclude i ask you this do we really want to base legislation on a false premise and then subsequently force small scale beekeepers out of business or do we want to put an end to @ years ] of legal uncertainty in the sector and finally allow our beekeepers to get back to what they do best providing us with quality ) european ] honey
for the reasons i have mentioned the commission felt it necessary to come forward with a proposal clarifying the definition of pollen as a constituent i have supported this position from the beginning as have most of the member state governments
to make an exception of honey by requiring gm content below the threshold to be labelled will only serve to confuse consumers about labelling laws
if pollen is to be considered an ingredient then the
either
if gm pollen is labelled consumers will be receiving inconsistent information about gm content when compared with other foods
i do not do this blindly
this may not seem much if you are making a large batch but for many small producers the cost could be very crippling
of course the ingredient constituent argument has arisen due to the labelling implications of each option if pollen continues to be considered a constituent any gm pollen present would not need to be labelled
small producers will be hit hardest by the testing requirements
there are some in this chamber who are actively promoting this latter option even though it is based on a false premise because it would lead to some honey being labelled as food produced from gmos by doing this i think they believe they will score a small victory in the fight against gmos but they would in the process be using honey producers as collateral damage
if they succeed i think they will be doing the exact opposite
this is a dangerous road to start on
if pollen were to be defined as an ingredient honey would need to display a list of ingredients
the % eu ] has to consume more honey than anywhere else in the world honey producers must be able to capitalise on the markets right on their doorstep and should not be hindered or left unresolved by the fight over semantics between the % eu ] institutions
the colony collapse crisis has been primary amongst these while beekeepers battle to save their bees we must battle to save their industry in order to do this we must support the commission proposal and the amendments which designate pollen as a constituent of honey
i want to see the ) european ] production of honey increase
during this period we have had excellent and productive cooperation for which i am truly thankful to him
but at the same time there are also lessons from what did not go as well
we have to counteract any tendency to withdraw collectively from the health sector focusing on those countries falling below minimum public financing we need to think about how we can deploy our collective % eu ] health aid more effectively
~ secondly ] weak health systems in partner countries are a particular concern the % european union ] has committed to comprehensive health systems strengthening
there are many things we could write in our response at % eu ] level
the very positive role of the ` european centre for disease prevention and control ] in deploying epidemiologists
the % european union ] has a special responsibility when it comes to promoting universal health coverage supporting countries to achieve health related sustainable development goals and to build resilient
i would also like to take this opportunity to criticise the media for the way that they sensationally took this as an opportunity to increase their ratings and i know the ` bbc world news ] used it as an opportunity to have an ebola watch which was something like looking at criminals
i am a firm believer that with situations like this we can tackle the problems by looking at the causes and not actually just the symptoms and in the long term crises like these can be averted by increasing the wealth of the poorest people in the poorest nations
the % eu ] fisheries agreement in * western africa ] has deprived the poorest people of their livelihoods and this is having a huge effect on the poorest people 's ability to earn an income
it will be the most important instrument for the next epidemic
i saw on the ground the problems in those three countries and i realised that the lessons learned may be the most important basis for the future for us as an international community and we of course have to support those countries
has anything changed in the % eu ] programming for the future
there is no free healthcare for the ebola sufferers who suffer from longterm aftereffects of ebola
so we need to have a new programme for health and i am not clear whether the commission and its member states have got one and how they continue to coordinate because as you said we all pledged in % new york ] to have universal health coverage but it is not enough to keep pledging it we have to actually do it so we can do something in these countries and i really want to know what it is the commission is going to do
they were on the ground fighting this terrible disease before the politicians even started really talking about it then when we did act we did everything in slow motion
rather than convert buildings quickly into makeshift hospitals we did the job to a higher standard but it took @ many weeks ] during which time the crisis got worse so my message to the % eu ] to the member states to countries around the world is this next time please understand the urgent nature of emergencies
if such a review were to be identified we would consider this for the future
as stated in your report we will also be analysing amongst other things how convergence will impact the relevance and usefulness of the existing regulatory mechanism
while some point to the need for adjustments others argue that the directive which was adopted not so long ago still works well the option of self and co regulation has also been mentioned
the commission is open minded regarding the necessity for a review of the & avms directive ] in the follow up to the green paper consultation
this is why we have included these questions in the green paper
we are therefore looking forward to receiving feedback on this question in the public consultation with regard to increasing convergence in the audiovisual sector and the impact on the & audiovisual media services directive ] we have already encountered a wide range of views
the consultation is open until @ the end of august ]
madam president connected tv is an exciting innovation the hardware and the hyper platforms are already common in many homes but we are standing at the beginning of this revolution when it comes to the development of the software
this report highlights the challenges in areas such as media pluralism advertising and protection for minors
it also stresses the need to ensure fair competition between ) european ] content suppliers which are governed by % eu ] legislation and major international platforms which are not
we also need to look at the rules governing advertising in the audiovisual media and the protection of minors
they do not currently apply to the internet
we are therefore calling on the commission to consider an appropriate ) european ] framework ensuring that content quality and integrity are the same whether it is broadcast or supplied by an alternative media platform
finally i would like to highlight the fact that there are still vast areas of the % uk ] and across * europe ] with poor internet infrastructures
unless we can address these challenges connected tv will be a luxury which can only be enjoyed by citizens living in urban areas with high internet speeds
we only bought time and why
the root of the problem is still there
its debt has been cut but its economy remains sinking because the euro is too expensive for them
mr president } charles dickens ] once described credit as a system by which people who have no money borrow from other people who have no money but pretend they have the summit has transformed the % european union ] into a debt union where debt is pumped around so we can all pretend we have money but in reality we do not
but @ today ] we have a more ambitious platform on which to build * europe ] 's future growth
i think it is unacceptable that a time of social crisis such as we have now in so many areas of * europe ] is precisely the moment when because of lack of decision on this matter we put some of the most vulnerable people in our societies at
i am also particularly pleased that the summit conclusions highlighted the role of the community method and of the commission in economic governance
society this type of response is of course most effective on a global scale where it can be used to address global challenges such as the fight against poverty this is a message i will push strongly for in
i think it is also important and relevant not only from a substantive but also from a symbolic point of view and symbols are important that by having a commissioner especially dedicated to the euro we assert that we want euro governance to take place within the community method and with the community institutions
while deeper integration of the * euro area ] is essential it must be done in a way that keeps the entire % european union ] strong
of times we will demonstrate our unity our solidarity and our determination for a ) european ]
we are determined to conclude work on a ~ second ] financial assistance programme by @ the end of this year ]
a communication on the external representation of the euro on the basis of & article one hundred and thirty eight ] of the treaty and a green paper on euro stability bonds as announced in my state of the union speech
i have always stated that any possible treaty change should not be seen as the immediate solution to the current crisis
~ third ] on banks the decisions taken @ yesterday ] by member states will pave the way for a restoration of confidence in the ) european ] banking sector we are working to design an approach for medium and long term funding of banks while also requiring banks to hold a significantly higher capital ratio after taking account of sovereign debt exposures the commission will continue to work hand in hand with the ` european banking authority ] the ` ecb ] and the ` eib ] to implement these measures through a fully coordinated approach at % european union ] level
@ today ] i can announce to you that i intend to entrust } olli rehn ] with a reinforced status and additional working instruments he is to become commission vice president for economic and monetary affairs and the euro this is the best way to guarantee independence objectivity and efficiency in the exercise of the commission 's responsibility of coordination
they include getting agreement on the & single market act ] by the end
~ first ] on % greece ] the solution found this morning includes a credible and appropriate degree of private sector involvement
this package will give direction to the moves towards integration and convergence
i am happy to say that most of these proposals are now reflected in the conclusions of the ` european council ]
the commission has argued @ for many months ] that to complete our monetary union with an economic union we need stronger governance in the euro
@ today ] i can announce to you that @ next month ] we will present a comprehensive package on further deepening % european union ] and euro area economic governance
i will consult widely with this house on the issue
this coherence and compatibility can only be achieved through the community institutions because they are the ones mandated to act in the interests of all our member states and our citizens in a rule based indeed treaty based
in @ a day ] as i said in this ` parliament ] in my ? state of the union ] address this is a marathon not a sprint but @ today ] we are witnessing a level of determination that should give hope and confidence
it is now imperative that % italy ] implement these commitments fully and according to a clear and coherent timetable
risk for its part the commission has also pledged to fast track a number of proposals
level * europe ] strives to lead the global crisis response at the # g twenty ] but of course we will not have the credibility to lead if we can not show as we have shown that we are able to move towards a real solution for our own problems by the @ end of this year ] the commission will have presented all its proposals on overhauling the banking system in line with our # g twenty ] commitments that means over ! thirty ] pieces of legislation all of which aim to make the sector more responsible and to restore its position as a service to the real
but we will now go beyond the legislation recently adopted by this ` parliament ]
it is about restoring their trust and confidence in our social market economy
support * europe ] is also the ~ first ] constituency in the ` g twenty ] to have proposed a financial transaction tax which we shall present at the # g twenty summit ] in
the reinforcement of the governance of the * euro area ] must be done in a way that ensures the integrity of the single market and the whole & community acquis ]
for instance on @ thirty november ] we will put forward a proposal on facilitating access to venture capital as part of the single market
economy i know how much this ` parliament ] is committed to this agenda and i thank you for your constant
the commission is committed to a true economic union through increased convergence
% cannes ] i believe that the protest movements we have witnessed in recent weeks from % madrid ] to % manhattan ] show that this is the kind of action people expect from their leaders to ensure that the financial sector contributes to
increasing the credibility of our firewalls is the single most crucial element of our crisis resolution efforts the element that underpins the credibility of all our other actions
it will give energy to our joint efforts the efforts of all the institutions and it will do so while upholding the principle of prioritising the community method in this context the independent and objective authority of the commission is even more important a view often expressed by this ` parliament ]
the commission is now working on the proposals i presented in my state of the union address and in my announcement to this house of the commission 's roadmap to stability and growth
we do not want artificial divisions between the member states of the * euro area ] and all the other member states of the % european union ]
let me take the ! five ] elements briefly one by one
we will also anticipate in this package the annual growth survey to give even more coherence and focus to the preparation of @ next year ] 's economic policies
on @ sunday ] the ` european council ] devoted a great part of its work to this and i am pleased to have presented my vision the vision of the ` european commission ] to all the heads of state and government
the ` european parliament ] has to be fully involved in such major changes
this will include a codecision regulation linking surveillance with efsf and esm assistance on the basis of & article one hundred and thirty six ] of the treaty
~ second ] the agreement on the leveraging of the efsf means that we have also maximised the potential of our backstops
surveillance and enforcement in the area of the economic governance of the % union ] and of the * euro area ] in particular
of @ two thousand and twelve ] fully implementing the & services directive ] and rapidly adopting our proposals to temporarily increase co financing rates in countries under adjustment programmes
but it is true that by working to embed stricter discipline and stronger governance into the * euro area ] in particular we may help to prevent a future crisis
renewal it is clear that growth and prosperity will not be restored
this will ease market pressure on % greece ] and allow the country to continue its programmes of reforms
these decisions will be transmitted to this house before the @ november ] plenary session and both } olli rehn ] and } algirdas emeta ] are ready to appear before the relevant parliamentary committee
area we need more integration more discipline more convergence
@ before the end of this year ] the commission will propose a youth opportunities initiative to boost youth employment also building on the resources of the european social fund
the bold decisions taken over @ the last days ] and indeed over @ the last weeks ] and @ months ] allow us to take a message to our partners at the # g twenty summit ] in % cannes ] of a * europe ] that is determined that is responsible that is united * europe ] will push at the # g twenty ] for an ambitious action plan that can address the challenges and imbalances that are still hindering growth at the global
at the same time i believe that it is also important to ensure the credibility and further reinforce the independence and objectivity of all our technical work not only in terms of economic preparations but also in terms of the independent collection of statistical
in effect heads of state and government have pledged to build on the measures of the ! six ] pack and the ) european ] semester by strengthening the commission 's role in assessing monitoring and coordinating national economic policies and budgets
they mean the beginning of a long path of hard work
we insisted that the different aspects of the crisis should be tackled together and not in a piecemeal purely reactive fashion we set this out in the roadmap to stability and growth which i presented to you on @ twelve october ] and also sent to heads of state and government at the same time
a global approach to stabilise the euro and i am relieved because finally and it has to be repeated we are now abandoning our hesitant approach of @ the last twenty months ] let us also be very blunt about that this crisis and the reason for this mess has been prolonged and worsened by the way this has been handled from the beginning
what we need is to use article ~ twenty eight ] of the conclusions of @ yesterday ]
but that is not the economic governance we
a few good days on the markets do not mean that we have already reached our goal and that the euro is still stable and again stable and again strengthened
commons but let us be honest he is pleased to be outside but he wants to be inside to influence all these decisions and he is criticising
will we possibly see control of the region 's banking system handed over to the * middle east ] and * asia ]
as the leaders of * europe ] have been bickering and squabbling and falling deeper into the mire the newly elected president should surely have jumped to attention and started to flex his muscles
outside the ` united nations ] you stated that the % eu ] was the fatherland of democracy
but you have been about as visible as credit in the ) european ] governments treasury
the euro has done more for ) european ] disunity than anything else turning country against country leader against leader taxpayer against government
* europe ] is not giving new money to the banks and instead they are expected to find ( eur one hundred billion ] themselves and also write down ( eur twenty billion ] of ) greek ] debt this can only come from restricted lending or from outside investors taking advantage of the buyers market and will probably end up buying up most of the ) european ] banking system
perhaps you are going to take raffle tickets to the next ` g twenty ] meeting with the top prize being % greece ] this whole period has raised some serious questions about you mr } van rompuy ]
how will that affect growth in the economy
they start with the ` council ] congratulating itself for having taken unprecedented steps to combat the effects of the financial crisis
now it is calling on member states to focus public spending on growth areas but there is no real public money available to spend on growth areas in the @ next few years ] what with the collapse in growth rates and the demand that deficits be brought under ! three ] by
@ two thousand and twelve ] this is fundamentally anti democratic
the conclusions go on to talk about our ambitious agenda for growth but the truth is we simply do not have an agenda for growth and we certainly do not have one for job creation
it is quite outrageous that the conclusions talk about improving the growth and employment outlook
it would shift the essence of the & stability and growth pact ] away from political debate and profoundly affect the way that progressive politics can be conceived and pursued at both national and ) european ] level the other striking thing about these conclusions mentioned by ) martin schulz ] is the total lack of regard for this ` parliament ]
it is an attempted rightwing coup which tries to freeze out alternative ideological approaches to dealing with the crisis
the budget balance concept is a political concept and if it becomes embedded in national constitutions it will permanently enshrine a major chunk of rightwing ideology moving it away from normal democratic processes
the fact is that it has been forced to take unprecedented steps but always too little and too late forced to do so by nervous markets because of its uncertainty and hesitation
we should have with ! twenty three million ] people unemployed but incredibly these conclusions do not even mention unemployment
@ two thousand and thirteen ] to make matters worse the conclusions later say that building on the ! six ] pack the ) european ] semester and the & europe plus pact ] * euro area ] member states will be required to adopt the fiscal rules translating the & stability and growth pact ] deficit and debt rules into national legislation preferably at a constitutional level by the end of
just @ a few weeks ago ] the ` council ] with the support of the ` liberals ] and ` epp ] here was happy to agree an economic governance package without accepting any differentiated treatment of public investment spending
this will never be passed
we should allow non ` eurozone ] members such as my country to decide again if they even wish to enter
this is an unprecedented case and i am afraid that it will create an enormous burden for the % eu ] economy and that it will result in very high long term costs
i have the feeling that the only answer to the current problems will be the reduction of the * eurozone ] and sooner or later this will have to be done like it or not
we have found a very costly and only temporary solution
that is the main reason why for instance the ) czech ] prime minister wishes to call a referendum on this matter which has my full support
the vast amount of both private and public funds will be poured into the debt bailouts
only a buying of time a temporary solution
! one ] good thing is the call for a balanced budget the so called balanced budget rule
i was very pleased to see @ sunday ] 's ` council ] giving a renewed commitment to completion of a single market
this means that we are at the very beginning of a massive fiscal transfer and one never before seen in ) european ] history
that is the only reasonable way out of this mess
mr president dear colleagues good morning as i said to the journalist only > a few hours ago ] all the % union ] 's institutions and governments have been expending significant political capital
it also includes a voluntary contribution by private creditors who had lent to % greece ]
just because of the new instruments such as the european semester but also as a result of events @ today ] no government can afford to underestimate the possible impact of public debts or bubbles in another * eurozone ] country on its own economy
difficult improvements are possible and it can be useful to give the public and the markets a sense of our medium term
there is some truth in this
the new programme includes an extra effort by the official sector
this ambitious package in particular the measures to increase competiveness and to liberalise the economy now needs implementation
all along we had a double duty dealing with the current crisis and preventing a new ! one ] from arising
i am very happy about this achievement and your improvements to
that moreover monetary policy is at the heart of economic policy and the ! seventeen ] have a common monetary
and the ! twenty seven ] not only is it my intention to organise euro summits if possible immediately following a ` european council ] meeting but it is also the case that the commission and ` parliament ] will continue to play their
everything is in everything and vice versa
however during @ the summer ] some doubts crept in about the package 's implementation although these proved unfounded in the end all ! seventeen ] parliaments duly approved it within @ three months ] the harm was done
we approved a coordinated scheme to recapitalise banks across * europe ]
it became necessary to take further measures both for % greece ] and to stop contagion as well as to address weaknesses in the banking system
right this brings me to my concluding remark on our
we therefore took @ yesterday ] and on @ sunday ] important decisions on the ! five ] fronts where action is needed
@ sunday ] 's ` european council ] discussed this extensively and adopted measures to stimulate growth and create jobs beyond the immediate crisis we have all along kept sight of the broader picture
states my reasoning is
each option could lead to leverage of up to ! four ] or ! five ] times they can be used simultaneously so as to increase the robustness of the financing strategy
on top of this we have had to work since @ july ] in a different economic climate
we all work in the same direction sound budgets lower debts sustainable
we have identified ! two ] approaches for the efsf
equal they were asleep in the euro 's ~ first ] @ decade ] and even if they are currently overreacting the markets will not go back to sleep
mix monetary policy alone is not enough to deal with the situation
this is essential for the prospects for growth
among the ! twenty seven ] it gives the union cohesion and is the very basis of our prosperity
measures my intention is that we discuss ~ first ] the what before we discuss
from a series of national debt crises the situation was evolving into a systemic concern threatening the stability of the * eurozone ] as whole and this threat had to be contained
the ~ second ] front a sufficient firewall against contagion thanks to an agreement to multiply up to ! five ] fold the firepower of the ` european financial stability facility ] rescue fund
i have worked hard with all the ` european council ] members and in particular the president of the ` european commission ] to achieve this result
in this context the ` euro summit ] welcomes the clear commitment of % italy ] to achieve these objectives and to abide by the timetable it set itself
people who only focus on ! one ] or other aspect and rush to denounce them as insufficient miss the overall picture and the interactions between the various elements
> last night ] was a crucial political step which still requires as after any such meeting technical and legal follow up
you too have participated in that process for instance through the legislation on the supervision of the financial sector and more recently the ! six ] pack on economic governance
it is the overall combination of institutional pressure peer pressure and market pressure that will help us to avoid getting into such difficulties again all ! three ] forms of pressure have been enhanced institutional pressure above all thanks to the financial sector supervision and the ! six ] pack legislation
of trust i will personally do my utmost to avoid divisions between the ! seventeen ]
credible in politics one needs time to bring everybody on board and tie diverse interests together in a solid
reaction improving * europe ] 's capacity to act is the best sign of mutual trust we can give to the public the markets and ourselves
of a mouse political processes even if they are working at their most rapid cannot deliver
cement yet it is crucial that we put in place rules and procedures that will anticipate problems in the future and prevent them from
too late the markets have the luxury of moving at the speed of a click
package time is the politician 's
arising and it is also crucial that we develop emergency procedures enabling a more speedy and flexible
so speedily approval of the @ july ] package by the ! seventeen ] national parliaments in @ two and a half months ] is impressive by political standards even if it is slow by market
negotiation moreover at some point the request to always be faster is just not
the how ~ first ] we should examine the goals and only afterwards the legal instruments required to get there treaty changes are
the leverage could be around ( one trillion euros ] under certain assumptions about market conditions the set up and investors responsiveness in view of economic policies
together the ! five ] elements constitute a comprehensive package and are all interrelated
the ~ fourth ] front further fiscal consolidation by those member states which need more sustainable public finances and more structural reforms
} juncker ] of course any proposal for a treaty revision would also be a matter for your ` parliament ] to consider as indeed are other possible
sometimes i hear complaints that markets do not give democracies the time we need to get things approved
your debates and the work of your committees have also furnished many of the ideas that have shaped this process and in some cases decisively improved the outcome
so we must keep the ! two ] configurations as close as possible in a spirit
under the ~ second ] approach the fund could set up one or several special purpose vehicles to finance its operations
market speculation can sometimes become a self fulfilling prophecy
impact the president of the commission and i both have this experience
the ~ first ] one aims at giving credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by member states
again let me stress that these ! three ] types of pressure to induce responsible behaviour reinforce each
policy yet we need a policy
state guarantees to improve the longer term funding will safeguard the flow of credit to the real economy
in the end only sustained economic growth can bring back confidence create jobs and absorb deficits
growth that is the result the citizens
and of course most of them will in due course join the euro however it is vitally important to safeguard the integrity of the single market
let me take ! one ] step back i should like to underline that the decisions taken by the four summit meetings @ since sunday ] are part of a process which has lasted for @ more than a year ]
market volatility began to grow and this during the very days when brinkmanship in the ` us congress ] about their potential default was adding to the flames
we cannot have a common currency and a common monetary policy and leave everything else to the states
global economic growth is slowing dramatically not only in * europe ] but also in the % united states ] and some emerging countries
use of time the % european union ] is often charged with coming up with too little
the ~ first ] front a sustainable solution for the ) greek ] debt
further let me be clear the * eurozone ] is not a derogation from the % european union ] it is part
the ratio of highest quality capital will be increased to
i should also like to underline that stimulating growth is an essential part of the package
summits some have expressed the fear that these will lead to divisions between member
on dealing with the debt crisis
the immediate political reaction to the @ july ] package was positive
they would be punished by the voters if one compares this situation with that of @ ten years ago ] the pressure which leaders put on each other has become much more intense as we have seen in recent
direction but a treaty change is not the right way to deal with an immediate financial crisis so we have to get the different time perspectives
but i am deeply convinced the markets will give us the time we need when they see a clear direction and a clear determination
a new % eu ] imf programme of up to ! one hundred billion ] will be put in place by @ the end of the year ]
we also commend % italy ] 's commitment to achieve a balanced budget by @ two thousand and thirteen ] and we take note of the plan to increase the retirement age to @ sixty seven years ] by
taking emergency actions like setting up rescue funds while also putting together step by step a new economic governance to help avoid future problems
it we took a further step last night in agreeing that for * euro area ] member states in an excessive deficit procedure the commission and the council will be able to examine national budgets and adopt an opinion on them before their adoption by the relevant national parliament peer pressure has also become more effective not
simple it is perfectly natural that those who share a common currency take some decisions together in fact ! one ] of the origins of the current crisis is that almost everybody had underestimated the extent to which the economies of the * eurozone ] are linked and we are now remedying
roles a ~ third ] and final institutional remark the # euro summit ] decided to reflect on a further strengthening of economic convergence within the * euro area ] and on improving fiscal discipline and deepening economic union including exploring the possibility should this prove necessary of limited treaty
investment being committed to sustainable inclusive growth and also to employment
since many of our member states do not have the fiscal space to do this we are proposing to use the community level so that we can promote growth through some kind of public investment in the ` european council ] discussion on growth i had the occasion to put forward some proposals
this is why it is important to have convergence but also discipline if we want to have a true ` european economic union ] we need both
sometimes in * europe ] when people criticise the % european union ] they should be more precise about what they are criticising is it the % european union ] as a project
i believe the heads of government and our member states are learning that lesson
for instance in point ! twenty six ] they make a commitment of course it is a political commitment but it is an important one that at national level they will stick to the recommendations of the commission and the relevant commissioner regarding the implementation of the stability and growth pact even before any kind of formal decision by the ` council ]
unfortunately this has not yet been done
determined implementation
this is not only about austerity
we need more than ever a stronger % european union ] we need more than ever a strong euro and we will work for that if there is convergence between the main institutions
at the same time we can internally in the % european union ] try to see what we can do to avoid this kind of behaviour
that is where i want to ask you also to make the case for * europe ] in our own countries as was highlighted on several occasions
we need growth and to have growth we need more investment public investment
it is not just about convergence we need more discipline so that we can achieve a higher degree of integration
this is exactly the kind of behaviour that we cannot accept in the future
i believe that we do have the circumstances where governments understand that if they really want to keep financial stability and to stick to a common currency more discipline more integration and more convergence is needed
regarding the economic governance of the euro area let me put things clearly we are in the current situation in * europe ] not only because there was irresponsible financial behaviour but also because our member states or most of them did not respect their commitments regarding the & stability and growth pact ]
that banks should be subject to constraints regarding the distribution of dividends and bonus payments until the target has been attained @ yesterday ] in the ` european council ] i said to the ) european ] heads of state and government that the commission is ready to bring forward a regulation if they really want to be sure that the banks will respect this orientation
such as project bonds the connecting europe facility and the possibility of anticipating some of the proposals for the next multiannual financial framework so that we can also show our citizens that we are serious when we speak about the possibilities of growth and are ready to make some kind of public
~ first ] of all many of you spoke about banks and why we are taking decisions for banks and not being tougher with them
mr president it is good that some progress was made during the # european council summit ] > last night ] and it seems that the financial markets are cautiously celebrating i am pleased that president } van rompuy ] and president } barroso ] are here > this morning ]
the * eurozone ] countries must of course find a solution to the problems inherent in fiscal union
we need more details of the changes to the efsf as decisions taken behind closed doors seem confusing in the cold light of day
the weak must be strengthened but in the short term this is a big ask of the strong especially % germany ]
concerning the ` efsf ] the credit enhancement option has similarity to mortgage and ) us ] department guarantees whilst the spv option has similarities with known structured products
the spv funds need to be found at a reasonable cost and then we will have a window to get the growth package working and sort out the debt overhang or we will find ourselves facing similar problems again
bank recapitalisation and still missing crisis resolution are overdue in part because of political weakness and previous denials of the situation
finally overall we still have to find a solution for the fact that growth was built on debt for too long
% spain ] like % ireland ] has piled its debt onto the shoulders of its citizens
yes we have bought some time but the feel good factor did not last past lunchtime @ today ]
as a large country it was able to demand and get those few extra crumbs from the table but that in the final analysis is all it amounts to
it is because of the toxic link between insolvent banks and sovereign states that are already under significant pressure
surely % eu ] leaders can see that we are fast approaching the end of the line
we need emergency scaffolding to prop up the crumbling infrastructure of the * euro ] right now and in my view the minimum required is some kind of banking union a deposit interest guarantee scheme % eu ] wide banking supervision and regulation and crucially some kind of bank resolution scheme
yes there are some cosmetic differences and some face saving for % spain ]
her life and reign epitomise devotion to duty commitment sacrifice courage and impeccable judgment
we in % northern ireland ] look forward to a visit from her majesty later @ this month ]
i believe it fitting that this house join with parliaments and politicians across the world in marking this significant milestone by sending warmest congratulations to her majesty and to his royal highness the duke of % edinburgh ] on this # diamond jubilee ]
madam president in recent days we in the % united kingdom ] and across the * commonwealth ] have been celebrating the diamond jubilee of her majesty queen } elizabeth ii ] marking her @ sixty years ] as monarch and her steadfast selfless service
it will be our opportunity to celebrate to thank her for her reign over us and to wish her well in @ the years ahead ]
we can all greatly learn from her majesty 's example
in return she has the affection love and respect of people right across the world
the new government will need to deal decisively with the debt crisis unemployment and above all with the systemic corruption which is blocking the ) serbian ] economy and % serbia ] 's society
i hope that the new ` national assembly ] will execute its oversight powers more aggressively in the future
i hope that the outcome of the ongoing negotiations will result in a deal that brings a stable and strong pro ) european ] parliamentary majority
% serbia ] needs an active parliament if it is to meet its challenges in the ) european ] integration processes
this is irrespective of the fact that the consumer may return the car to the rental company with fuel remaining and the consumer will not be and is not reimbursed
while respecting the specific arrangements for close cooperation between ` parliament ] and commission that are set out in the & framework agreement ] we respect and will continue to respect that & framework agreement ] and while respecting each of the ! three ] institutions roles under the treaties it is by working better upstream that we believe we can really make sure our combined efforts deliver effective and ambitious results to address the challenges * europe ] faces
you know this already
the need to create jobs and to create growth
we intend to adopt the @ two thousand and sixteen ] work programme on @ twenty seven october ] in the run up the commission will engage actively in dialogue with ` parliament ] in full accordance with the framework agreement
a first orientation debate will be held in college @ a week from now ]
and then of course @ next year ] will also be the year of the mff mid term review which is also going to be a big challenge for both our institutions
that comes on top of the ! one hundred and forty ] proposals which are pending on the table of the co legislators
i hope that we can work closely together with ` parliament ] on this
i want to mention this at the start of my contribution @ today ] because i do believe that we as ) europeans ] whatever our position may be on ) european ] integration on ) european ] cooperation at that moment had a sense of destiny of common destiny
where legislation is the right response to address the big things we will be big on legislation
in conclusion mr president aligning our political priorities and planning can help make all the difference to whether ) europeans ] look at * europe ] as part of the problem or rather as part of the solution to the huge challenges they face
some of these proposals are already before you and more are coming starting with the revision of the energy labelling and emissions trading legislation @ next week ]
we need to be i believe pragmatic and result oriented
i remember vividly those days
we will present an action plan for developing a real capital markets union in @ autumn ] and we will accompany it with the ~ first ] legislative proposals in the most pressing areas
let me say something briefly about @ this year ] 's state of play and the commission work programme
our strategic agendas those we have already presented and those still to come @ later this year ] will obviously be the main frame and we will keep a clear focus on delivering what we have announced there
the importance of the social dimension in & emu ] obviously but also more widely is something president } juncker ] and i are both very attached to
if i look back at the @ last couple of years ] we have seen that * europe ] is facing a number of huge challenges terrorism as i just mentioned
the college will have a further orientation debate dedicated to social policy immediately after the summer before looking ahead towards @ two thousand and sixteen ] i would like to stress that it takes in this case oddly enough ! three ] to tango
to launch and guide our discussion a letter of intent will be sent in parallel with the state of the union address here in this house
our proposal pays particular attention to reinforcing and consolidating the annual and multiannual planning and programming
so please remember that those are the pivotal points in our commission work programme
